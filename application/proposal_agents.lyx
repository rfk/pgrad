Reasoning in Agent Programming Languages
\newline 
Initial Research Proposal
\layout Author

Ryan Kelly

The field of Agent Programming aims to represent and develop software systems
 in terms of

agents

\end_inset 

 - autonomous software entities with properties such as beliefs, desires
 and intentions.
 This model of programming shows promise in a wide variety of fields, not
 least because it allows the programmer to think about the task at hand
 in terms of how they, an autonomous agent, would approach it.

Agent programming has been approached on the one hand from a practical standpoin
t based on the procedural programming paradigm.
 This has resulted in languages such as JACK and Jade, which are based around
 procedural plans which are executed when certain conditions are met.
 These languages have the advantage of making programmers feel more

at home

 due to their largely procedural approach, and allowing access to existing
 bodies of code in the host language (typically Java).

The idea of rational agents also has a strong theoretical background which
 has spawned several systems of logic for reasoning about agent-based systems.
 These logics typically allow key concepts such as beliefs, desires and
 intentions to be represented and manipulated explicitly.
 This has been the basis for several agent programming languages such as
 ConGolog and 3APL, which take a declarative approach.
 A key advantage of such approaches is the capacity for formal reasoning
 about the properties of the system - the ability to prove statements such
 as

x will not occur

 or

y will eventually be the case

.

I propose to investigate ways of making the advantages of both approaches
 available to programmers of agent-based systems.
 This will involve a review of the state-of-the-art in both procedural and
 declarative agent programming, and an investigation of agent programming
 languages in practical use to determine the specific advantages that each
 provides.
 The intention is then to develop a proof-of-concept language to combine
 the most useful of these advantages.
