Theorem proving:

  - how to handle equality.  Currently thinking it should be a third
    kernel type eq(A B).  Maybe addNode could re-write the terms it
    recieves based on the equalities recorded along the path?

  - handling of existentially-quantified variables.  They need to be names
    rather than variables. Needs to tie in with equality handling.

  - integration of constraint-based reasoning about time
