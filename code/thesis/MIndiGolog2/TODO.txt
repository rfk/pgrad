Theorem proving:
  - can simplification be done using the same exploration procedure?
  - integration of constraint-based reasoning about time
  - TermSet should really be called "PredSet"
  - Support for Axioms
  - make VarMap.map thread-safe

  - {FOF.prove} generates multiple identical solutions - fix!

Sitcalc:
  - full concurrent action support
  - exogenous actions
