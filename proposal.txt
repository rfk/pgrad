Particle Swarm Optimisation (PSO) is a population-based optimization technique, motivated by the simulation of animal social behaviors such as fish schooling or bird flocking. As with other population-based optimization methods (e.g. Genetic Algorithms) the PSO algorithm starts by randomly initialising a population of individuals (particles) in the search space. Unlike other evolutionary methods, PSO involves no recombination of genetic material between individuals, instead utilising social behavior of particles in the swarm. At each timestep, it seeks the global optimal solution by adjusting the trajectory of each individual towards its own best location and towards the best particle of the entire swarm.
I propose several novel parameter automation strategies and new extensions to the particle swarm concept. The major objective of this development is to improve performance after a pre-defined number of generations, determined through empirical simulations using well-known benchmarks.
