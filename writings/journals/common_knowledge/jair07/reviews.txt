Dear Prof. Kelly,

Thank you again for submitting your following paper to JAIR:

Paper Number: 2650
Title: Common Knowledge, Hidden Actions, and the Frame Problem
Authors: Ryan Kelly (rfk@csse.unimelb.edu.au) and Adrian Pearce

There are three reviews for this paper, and they are attached. The first 
reviewer is cautiously positive, noting the technical strength of the 
paper but with concerns about presentation and organization. The second 
reviewer is negative, with main reservations on how the results can be 
actually applied. The third reviewer is positive. I agree with the 
reviewers that the paper's technical results are solid. But I also think 
the concerns raised by the second reviewer about the computational 
properties of the proposed framework should be addressed. I thus 
conclude that the paper may need some major revision to make it 
acceptable for publication in JAIR. Under JAIR policy, this means that 
your paper is rejected but with encouragement to resubmit. If you do 
decide to resubmit, please include a letter detailing how you have 
responded to the reviewers' comments.

I acknowledge that it has taken us more than four months to get back to 
you on this submission, much longer than our normal reviewing time. It 
is also the longest among all the papers that I have handled since 
becoming an associate editor three years ago. I just want to let you 
know that JAIR is committed to a relatively rapid publication cycle. 
What happens here is definitely not the norm. Chances are that we will 
do better the next time.

Best regards,

REVIEW - JAIR PAPER 2650

Common Knowledge, Hidden Actions, and the Frame Problem
Ryan F. Kelly
Adrian R. Pearce
=======================================================


General comments
----------------

This paper presents an interesting account of multi-agent knowledge in the
situation calculus, that extends the standard account of knowledge due to
Scherl and Levesque to permit group-level epistemic modalities like common
knowledge, partially observable and hidden actions, and regression as a
reasoning tool in these settings. As a result, this paper describes a powerful
approach to multi-agent knowledge which is suitable for modelling complex
multi-agent domains in the situation calculus.

In general, this work is technically sound and offers a valuable contribution.
However, the paper's structure at times complicates the overall presentation
of these results, making them difficult for the reader to understand.

Overall evaluation: accept with minor revisions


Specific comments
-----------------

Some questions and suggestions for improvement:

pp. 2-4: I don't think the extended introduction in the subsections
"Individual Knowledge with Hidden Actions" and "Complex Epistemic Modalities"
is completely necessary. The points in these sections can be incorporated
directly into the main text of the appropriate sections and the "Introduction"
section can be slightly extended to provide the necessary overview and
motivation. Also, inline statements like "this section is a greatly expanded
version of our conference paper..." are better off in footnotes.

p. 2, Individual Knowledge with Hidden Actions section: Is there a downside to
decoupling knowledge in the manner you describe? What's the trade-off?

p. 3, Complex Epistemic Modalities section: I'm not sure what is meant by an
"individual-level knowledge operator" here.

p. 4, Section 2: A reference to (McCarthy & Hayes, 1969) could be added
before (Pirri & Reiter, 1999).

p. 4, Section 2, paragraph 1, sentence 3: This sentence could be stronger and
more direct.

p. 5, paragraph 1: "Some example formulae from this domain are: ..." The
examples here aren't really formulae; they're English language assertions. The
examples following "Written formally: ..." are (logical) formulae expressing
the concepts in the English language assertions.

p. 5, Definition 1: Reword the statement of this definition to remove "etc".

p. 5, sentence 2 after Definition 2: "We assume an arbitrary, but fixed, basic
action theory". In what way is the BAT "fixed"?

p. 5, Definition 2: \phi is used in this definition but is not defined until
after it.

p. 5, last paragraph: "The notation...particular situation s' inserted into
all its fluents". Maybe add "replacing the existing situation term" or
something to that effect.

p. 6: "Pinto (1994) provides a full discussion of this issue" should end with
a period.

p. 6: Footnote 1 should end with a period.

p. 7, "This notation for...with the following definitions": A bit more
intuition here would be useful. The use of action description predicates with
<_alpha is fundamental to the results that follow and a simple example here
using Poss, for instance, would be helpful to the reader.

p. 7: Is the standard "<" macro (e.g., used by Reiter to describe
executability and expressed in terms of \sqsubset) used in your account?

p. 8, "The foundational axioms \Sigma define..." It might be worthwhile to
state the foundational axioms, especially since you seem to be making changes
to the standard account.

p. 8: In the definition of Knows0 the variable "s" does not appear on the
right hand side of the definition.

p. 8: I'm not sure Definition 3 is really needed. You could just state
something like "we will denote axioms (2) and (3) as the set D^std_K".

p. 9, Definition 4: Do you consider both relational and functional fluents in
your definition of uniform formulae? E.g., the formula F(g(s), s) is uniform
according to the standard (Reiter) definition of uniform formulae but does not
seem to be permitted by Definition 4. (Functional fluents are used in the
example in Section 3.5.)

p. 10, paragraph 1: Should the regression operator R also surround \Phi^+ and
\Phi^- in the third regression rule?
 
p. 13, equation (5): What is the result of the "dot" operation between a set
and a sequence of sets?

p. 16, Section 3.4, equation (12): PbU is used in this equation (and
elsewhere) with a single argument (agent), however, in equation (7) on p. 14
PbU has three arguments (agent, action set, situation). What happened to the
other arguments? Are they suppressed?

p. 17, definition of Knows in terms of views: Overloading "Knows" as a macro
makes it somewhat difficult on the reader since views and situations are not
equivalent (they are different sorts and have different semantics). 

p. 18, Section 3.5 (and elsewhere): Centred lists of equations are somewhat
difficult to read. You may want to consider lining up the "\equiv"s or
left-justifying all equations.

p. 19, Example 1 and p. 20, Example 3: "Which is entailed by the domain." The
initial "W" in "Which" should be lowercase.

p. 21, Section 3.6: The voice in this section is a little odd. Is this section
a proposal or an actual extension? (I.e., you use phrases like "the following
could be used..." and "we might have an axiom...") Clarify the intent of this
section.

p. 22, paragraph 2: The theorem of Scherl and Levesque (2003) mentioned here
is important since it allows particular modal logics of knowledge to be
modelled using their approach. You might want to explicitly include this point
and then claim that your approach also permits similar representations. You
may also want to mention that your formulation reduces the problem to
(equality) reasoning about views.

p. 22: "see the reference for details (Kelly & Pearce, 2007b)" => "see (Kelly
& Pearce, 2007b) for details".

p. 23: "Equivalently, it can be defined as..." => "Equivalently, common
knowledge can be defined as..."

p. 23, the famous "Coordinated Attack" problem: Is this the same as the
Byzantine Generals Problem described in (Lamport, Shostak, and Pease, 1982)?

p. 23, last sentence: The tone of the language in the sentence "Given the deep
similarities...we can be confident..." is a little rough. Please reword.

p. 26, Section 4.4: It might be helpful to the reader to include some
intuitions behind the idea of an epistemic path early in this section.

p. 26, Definition 8: The "Let ... then" structure of this definition is a
bit awkward.

p. 27, Section 4.5: I think the motivation of this section can be made clearer
without necessarily stating all the equivalences between [E,C]Knows and
PKnows, since these are repeated in Theorem 12. 

p. 27, "But this macro expands...": The "B" should be lowercase and this
phrase should not start a new paragraph.

p. 28, "Most of these clauses are straightforward, but note how the clause for
an individual agent term encodes the successor-state axiom for K0": You might
want to be a bit more precise here.

p. 29, proof sketch for Theorem 5: A period should appear before "For the
complete proof, see Appendix B".

p. 29, "The idea is to use the empty action term..." I would like to see a
small clarification and/or back reference here, especially in light of the
statement on p. 6: "Note that it is never possible to perform an empty set of
actions". What does it mean that "nothing happens"? Is do({},s) = s?

p. 31: The statements of Theorems 8, 9, and 10 are not precise. I.e., change
to "for any agent agt, situation s, action set c, ..." and so on.

p. 33: The claim of "effective" reasoning has been made a number of times in
this paper (e.g., also p. 22). Is it possible to expand on what you mean by
this, maybe in terms of the form of the basic action theories you have
identified in (Kelly and Pearce, 2007b)?

pp. 34-36: The formulae on these pages are at times difficult to read. Try
lining up the multiline equations differently. Also, is "=>" a meta-level
proof operator or logical implication (both "=>" and "->" appear at times)?

p. 39, paragraph 5: "For example, an agents could assume..." Remove "an"?

Review #2

Review of JAIR  2650:

Ryan F. Kelly and Adran R. Pearce,
Common Knowledge, Hidden Actions, and the Frame Problem

Contribution:
-------------
The paper considers a generalization of the work by Scherl and Levesque on a
solution to the frame problem for knowledge. The main extensions are:
- a multi-agent setting with concurrent actions
- an agent's actions and their sensing results may be unobservable to
other agents
- common knowledge is addressed
- successor state axioms and regression are defined for these richer epistemic
notions.

General Comments:
-----------------
I like very much the idea of using a notion of observability to define epistemic
accessibility and hence an agent's knowledge. This way "hidden" actions whose
effects may be unobservable to an agent can be accounted for in an elegant way.
The proposed solution to regressing knowledge in the presence of hidden actions
and in the case of common knowledge is interesting but also problematic. The
main motivation for using regression is that it provides a very effective
computational mechanism to reduce reasoning about the "future" to reasoning
about the "present." And indeed, until now such a mechanism did not exist for
either unobservable actions or common knowledge.  However, your proposal relies
on calculating fixed point of formulas, which may be difficult (undecidable),
and they may not even exist. You give examples where the fixed points are easily
obtained, but it remains unclear how useful your mechanism is in more general
terms, which limits the significance of your work for AI purposes. In fact, it
is not clear to me whether your proposal fares any better computationally than
others who need to resort to second order logic to deal with unobservable
actions. I would encourage you to identify special classes of theories where
your approach is actually computationally viable, that is, the fixed points are
guaranteed to exist and are computable.

The second part of the paper dealing with common knowledge (Section 4) is
very dense and difficult to digest. For example, the embedding of FODL
in terms of Golog is all done in a little over two pages, and this includes an
introduction to Golog. I was actually suprised that this is all relegated to an
appendix. Moreover, I am missing a proof that the embedding is actually
correct wrt the definition of KDo on page 26.
As in the first part of the paper, the question remains, as you point out,
whether your approach can be made computationally effective.

Given that the paper is already very long, I would suggest splitting it in two,
one that deals with knowledge and unobservable actions, and another for common
knowledge. Also, in order to make the results significant from an AI point of
view, the computatonal aspect needs to be addressed much more
carefully. Alternatively, a more logic-oriented journal should be targeted.

Detailed comments:
------------------
p.10: you use set notation to define res. At the very least explain how all this
can be encoded in first-order logic.

p.11, Section 2.4: You introduce P(\phi,\alpha) as a "meta-operator" (explain
what that means) and use it like a formula. This is confusing, and only after
looking at your 2007 paper I was able to make sense of it, sort of. The trouble
is that P(\phi,\alpha) may not exist, as it is only defined in terms of an
algorithm, which may not terminate. At the very least you need to hedge and say
that, whenever you use the operator inside a formula, then its existence is
assumed. Also the results you refer to on page 11 only appeared in a conference
paper without full proofs, which makes me a bit uneasy.

Def. 5+6: As these are not formal definitions, I suggest that you do not call
them definitions.

p.13, eq. 5: should you not use "c" instead of "a" for the actions?

p.16, eq. 12: As said earlier, this makes sense only if P(_,_,_) exists.

p.25: Earlier, K_0 was introduced to talk about what is accessible
initially. Now I am puzzled that you use K_0 for non-initial situations.

p.26, Def. 8: You introduced "uniform formulas" to stand for situation-calculus
formulas which are about a particular situation. Do formulas in  epistemic paths
mention any situation (which?), or do you mean situation-suppressed formulas?

You use KDo both as a 3- and 5-place macro. I suggest renaming the latter.

p.42: KDo is now defined in terms of EDo and KDo_cps. I was expecting a theorem
stating the correctness of your embedding wrt the earlier def. of KDo.
As the paper should be self-contained, a much more detailed introductin to Golog
is needed.

Review #3

Paper Title: Common Knowledge, Hidden Actions, and the Frame Problem
Authors: Ryan F. Kelly and Adrian R. Pearce

Recommendation: Accept with minor revisions

General comments

The paper makes significant contributions to reasoning about knowledge
and action. First, it generalizes Scherl and Levesque's account of
knowledge in the situation calculus to support partial observability of
actions; the regression operator is extended to deal with this.  The
extension uses a property persistence operator which computes what
properties persist over arbitrary long sequences of actions that
satisfy given constraints, in this case, action that are not
observable by the agent.  Secondly, it further extends regression to
handle common knowledge.  The latter uses techniques from dynamic
logic to represents paths in dymanic epistemic frames and define a
path regression operator; this approach was proposed earlier by van
Benthem et al. in the context of LCC, a propositional logic, but here
the approach is extended and adapted to the situation calculus.

There are some relatively minor problems with the treatment of common
knowledge (CKnows) in Section 4.  The paper defines CKnows and its
path version PKnows as infinite conjunctions.  But this means one has
to deal with infinite formulas.  Fixpoint definitions should be used
instead.  The latter should not be a problem when performing
regression as you treat CKnows and PKnows as primitives with respect
to regression.  (You could also make CKnows and PKnows primitives and
put their fixpoint definitions as axioms.)  Secondly, the paper never
actually gives a definition of the regression operator for CKnows and
PKnows.  It seems that one should first expand the latter into their
definitions as infinite conjunctions of PKnows_0 formulas, and then
regress the latter.  A definition of regression for CKnows and
PKnows should be given.  The notion of "regressible formula" should
also be redefined to reflect this.

The notation you use in regressing paths (Definitions 9 and 10) is
rather unintuitive, with its updating of substitutions.  It seems
unlikely that many users would be able to master this technique to
prove results by hand, unlike Scherl and Levesque's regression
operator, and the one you proposed in Section 3.  It would be
worthwile exploring whether the notation and approach can be made more
user friendly.  It might be possible to show some general lemmas that
could then be used to compute regression more easily.

In the conclusion, the paper should point out the limitations of the
approach, i.e. that allowing for an arbitrary number of unobservable
actions at all times is a very conservative reasoning strategy.  A
more fruitful approach in many contexts would be to assume that no
unobservable actions have occurred and revise one's beliefs when
observations contradict this.


Specific comments:

P. 3, line 5: typo "with what its observations"

P. 4 & references: typo "van Bentham 2007" --> "van Benthem 2007"

P. 5, 1st paragraph: the description of the example is a little
confusing: perhaps say that Bob and Ann are together in a room
initially, so they can see what what the other is doing.

P. 6, bottom paragraph: State explicitly that you assume that there is
a finite set of action types.  Concerning concurrent actions, are you
assuming some axiomatization of sets?  Which?  Are you assuming that
such sets are finite? Also, it would be good to say what sort the
variables you use range over, e.g. s for situation, a for actions, c
for concurrent, x y and z for objects.

P. 9, and throughout the paper: you should use long dash for
punctuation, not hyphen.

P. 10, 3rd paragraph: van Ditmarsh et al. "Optimal Regression for
Reasoning about Knowledge and Actions" in Proc AAAI'07 shows how
regression can be done without an exponential blowup.  Also re. (4):
it is not clear how the "res" definition is meant to be handled, to
produce a normal situation calculus formula.  Say that it ensures that
agt knows all the sensing results of the concurrent action c.

P. 11, 1st paragraph: There are ways to hide aspects of communication
actions so that only the agents involved observe them, e.g. the
"informWhether" and "informRef" actions of Khan & Lesperance in "ECASL
: A Model of Rational Agency for Communicating Agents" in
Proc. AAMAS'05.

P. 11, bottom: Mention the limitations of this approach: there are
cases where there is a unique least fixed point, but no n such that
P^n+1 = P^n.  Also "unique name axions FOR ACTIONS".

P. 13, 3rd paragrph: "We then add to D_{ad} AXIOMS ABOUT the action
description function"

P. 14, bottom: perhaps add that (8) and (9) mean that agents allow for
an arbitrary number of hidden actions between any two observations.

P. 16, line 14: are these two axions included in D^{obs}_k?

P. 17: It would be good to prove that your axiomatization is
equivalent to Scherl and Levesque's (S & L) when there are no hidden
actions, i.e. when (10) and (11) hold; the proof should be easy from
Theorems 2 and 3 and S & L's results.

P. 18: What axioms defining Obs are you using for the example?  The
ones on p. 16?

P. 21, line -5: typo "\leq_{actor(a)=agt}" should be
"\leq_{actor(a) \neq agt}".

P. 22, 1st paragraph: A related issue is that an agent should be aware
of the passage of time.  Even if it does not observe any actions by
others, the agent knows that time has passed and that more hidden
actions may have occurred.  How could this be modelled?  Perhaps with
clock tick actions?

P. 23, You say that CKnows "CAN BE defined as the infinite
conjunction..."  or as a fixpoint of EKnows; what definition do you
actually use?

P. 24, line 3: with sensing actions, Phi_K depends on s as well as on
c' and s'.  Line 15-17: "However, the macro CKnows can only make
assertions about the final situation... It is thus not expressive
enough to formulate a proper regression rule."  Your argument is not
really convincing.  It would be good to say a bit more about LCC: does
it support sensing actions, hidden actions by others?

P. 25, 1st paragraph: Mention section 4.3 in the outline.

P. 25, axiom (14): It might be better to use a new accessibility
relation K_{sync}, since K_0 is used for the initial knowledge
accessibility relation (as in S & L).  Similarly for PKnows_0.

P. 26: Perhaps mention the relationship of KDo with Golog in the main text.

P. 27, line -14: "we need to treat PKnows_0 syntactically as a
primitive fluent IN REGRESSION".  Also a figure might be helpful in
explaining what the path regression operator does.

P. 28, Definition 10: The definition is hard to understand.
Explain the main cases.  Perhaps the notation can be improved.
Give a few simple examples.

P. 28, bottom: Since you have extended regression to apply to
PKnows_0, you should extend the definition of regressible formula.

P. 29-30, definition of PKnows: Defining PKnows as an infinite
conjunction seems problematic.  One then has to deal with infinite
formulas and prove results about them (e.g. as in Theorem 7).  Why not
simply define E^*(s,s') to be the reflexive transitive closure of
E1(s,s')?  Then you can say that

PKnows(\pi,\phi,s) \equiv
  \forall s' E^*(s,s') --> PKnows_0(\pi,\phi,s') .

(You can make this the definition of PKnows or take it to be a
primitive and have the above as an axiom.  Either way should work,
since you will treat PKnows as a primitive in regression.)

You should actually give a definition of the regression operator for
CKnows and PKnows.

P. 31: Theorem 8 should hold not just for S_0 but for any situation.

P. 31, 1st line of Proof of Theroem 9: "lemma 8" should be "Theorem 8".

P. 32, line -6: What are T* and R*?

P. 34-35, Example 5: It is hard to get the intuition behind the proof.
The notation you use in regressing paths is rather unintuitive and I
can't see anyone using this to prove results by hand, unlike S & L's
regression operator.

P. 39, line 4: "these works" is balky English.

P. 41, line -3: "s,s')" is missing at the end of the line.

P. 43, end of Appendix A: perhaps show that your definition satisfies
Definition 9 as a Theorem?

P. 46, line 6: the first argument of KDo should be "agt".

P. 54: You are missing an author "Lesperance" in the 4th reference
Shapiro et al 2000.
