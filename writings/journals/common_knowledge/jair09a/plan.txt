* condense introduction into single section

* expand persistence condition section
    * decidable in some interesting cases: propositional, context-free

* implications of decoupling knowledge - more terms, more axioms, more complicated theory

* more on "elaboration tolerance" and modal properties

* approximate reasoning, and calcultaing persistence offline

* rename KDo/5 to something else - KTrans?

* drop embedding of FODL into Golog

* use K_s, PKnows_s for synchronous knowledge, to avoid overloading

* better path notation, from thesis

* revised PKnows proofs, from thesis

* more on limitations in conlcusion, e.g. knowledge under protocol, optimistic belief, etc
