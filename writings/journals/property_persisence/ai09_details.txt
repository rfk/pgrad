Property Persistence in the Situation Calculus
==============================================

Ryan F. Kelly and Adrian R. Pearce


Abstract
--------

We develop a new automated reasoning technique for the situation 
calculus that can handle queries containing universal 
quantification over situation terms. Although such queries arise 
naturally in many important reasoning tasks, they are difficult 
to automate in the situation calculus due to the presence of a 
second-order induction axiom. We show how to reduce queries about 
property persistence, a common type of universally-quantified 
query, to an equivalent form that does not quantify over 
situations and is thus amenable to existing automated reasoning 
techniques. The algorithm for doing so replaces induction with a 
meta-level fixpoint calculation; crucially, this calculation 
utilises only first-order reasoning with a limited set of axioms. 
The result is a powerful new tool for verifying sophisticated 
domain properties in the situation calculus.

Original contribution:
A new meta-level operator for working with formulae that universally quantify
over situation terms.  Similar to the regression operator R(), the "persistence
condition" operator P() rewrites the target formulae into a form that is more
amenable to effective automated reasoning.

Significance:
Despite appearing in many useful reasoning tasks, there are currently very
few tools for reasoning about formulae that universally quantify over
situation terms.

Our work differs by constructing a general-purpose reasoning tool rather than
focusing on a stand-alone application; in particular, our new operator 
integrates well with the use of the standard regression operator.

Usefulness to other researchers:
The persistence condition operator can be used as a kind of "black box"
tool for handling property persistence queries.  By factoring out the
inductive reasoning component, researchers may formulate more powerful
theories and applications of the situation calculus without forgoing
automated reasoning tools.

A preliminary version of this paper has previously appeared in IJCAI'07
(Kelly and Pearce, "Property Persistence in the Situation Calculus").
This revised edition includes extended and additional proofs, a more
comprehensive discussion of the termination properties of our algorithm,
and a detailed example of using the persistence condition to reason about
goal impossibility in a simple domain.
