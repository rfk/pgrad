%%  domain.pl:  Axiomatisation of the "Cooking Agents" domain for MIndiGolog
%%
%%  Author:  Ryan Kelly (rfk)
%%
%%  Date Created:  28/07/05
%%
%%    This file contains an axiomatisation of the "Cooking Agents" domain
%%    in the Concurrent, Temporal Situation Calculus with Natural Actions.
%%
%%    The domain consists of several agents and inanimate objects of
%%    different types (indicated by prim_obj/2) which in turn may
%%    be part of super-types (indicated by super_type/2).
%%
%%    Agents may acquire objects, place them inside/on container objects,
%%    and transfer the contents of one container object to another.  There
%%    are also an unlimited supply of timers in the world which may be
%%    set to ring at a specified time in the future.
%%
%%    The agents may also perform several continuous tasks, which have
%%    durations and may span several situations.  Agents may only perform
%%    one task at a time.
%%
%%    Depending on the tasks being performed, the contents of container
%%    objects may evolve from one situation to another.  For example,
%%    if the task mix(bowl1,5) is being performed (mix the contents of
%%    bowl1 for five minutees) then the contents might evolve from
%%    [egg1,flour1,sugar1] to mixed([egg1,flour1,sugar1],5).
%%
