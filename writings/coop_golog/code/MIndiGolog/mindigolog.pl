%%  Date Created:  28/07/05
%%
%%    This is an extension of the transition semantics for ConGolog given
%%    by De Giacomo et al ("ConGolog, a concurrent programming language
%%    based on the situation calculus") to operate with the extented 
%%    situation calculus defined in [sitcalc.pl].  Many of the transition
%%    operators are unchanged from this work, simply implemented in CIAO
%%    prolog.
%%
%%    This implementation will also incorporate a 'search' operator in
%%    the manner of IndiGolog, but this has not yet been implemented.
%%
%%    TODO:  document how programs are formed
%%
%%    The execution of an MIndiGolog program is defined by a transition
%%    semantics based on single-stepping and termination checking. For
%%    a program D and a situation S, the program may be partially
%%    executed to result in a new situation Sp and remaining program Dp
%%    if the predicate trans(D,S,Dp,Sp) holds.  A program D may legally
%%    terminate in situation S if the predicate final(D,S) holds.
%%
%%    It should be noted that many of the constructs in the Golog family
%%    of languaged involve some nondeterminism, so trans/4 and final/2
%%    are nondeterministic.
%%
%%    Programs can be executed in both an off-line and an on-line manner.
%%
%%    The predicate do(D,S,Sp) will take a program D and initial situation
%%    S and find a situation Sp in which the program will legally terminate.
%%    The actions performed by the program are available in the action
%%    history of Sp.  This predicate will backtrack over possible transitions
%%    until a legal execution is found, and will determine more legal
%%    executions when it is backtracked.  This provides offline execution
%%    (planning) for MIndiGolog programs.
%%
%%    The predicate ol_do(D,S) executes the program D in an on-line manner,
%%    beginning in situation S.  This means that it will not backtrack over
%%    the actions executed during operation of the program.  Online execution
%%    is not guaranteed to succeed even if D has a possible legal execution.
%%    For the moment, the actions executed are printed to standard output.
%%
%%    In general, the executions returned by do/3 will not be complete,
%%    but will be in the form of a final situation where the occurance times
%%    of actions are constrained in some way.  By contrast, ol_do/2 performs
%%    each action at the earliest possible time.
%%


%%
%%  final(D,S):  program termination is possible
%%
%%  The predicate final/2 is true when program D may legally terminate
%%  in situation S.  It is typically defined recursively for higher-order
%%  program constructs.  The specifics of each individual clause are
%%  explained below.
%%

%%  It is always legal for an empty program to terminate
final(nil,_).

%%  It is never legal for a program consisting of a single action
%%  to terminate, hence there is no clause for this case.

%%  It is never legal for a program consisting of a test to terminate,
%%  hence there is no clause for this case.

%%  Sequential performance of two programs may terminate only if both
%%  programs may terminate.
final(seq(D1,D2),S) :-
    final(D1,S), final(D2,S).

%%  Nondeterministic choice between two programs may terminate if either
%%  program may terminate.
final(choice(D1,D2),S) :-
    final(D1,S)
    ;
    final(D2,S).

%%  Nondeterministic choice of arguments may terminate if there is some
%%  choice of arguments for which the program will terminate.
final(pi(V,D),S) :-
    sub(V,_,D,Dr), final(Dr,S).

%%  Iteration of a program may always terminate, as it can legally be
%%  executed zero times.
final(star(_),_).

%%  Synchronised-if may terminate if the test is true and the true option
%%  may terminate, or the test is false and the false option may terminate.
final(if(Cond,D1,D2),S) :-
    holds(Cond,S), final(D1,S)
    ;
    holds(neg(Cond),S), final(D2,S).

%%  Synchronised-while may terminate if the test is false, or if the
%%  loop program may terminate.
final(while(Cond,D),S) :-
    holds(neg(Cond),S)
    ;
    final(D,S).

%%  Concurrent execution of two programs may terminate if both programs
%%  may terminate.
final(conc(D1,D2),S) :-
    final(D1,S), final(D2,S).

%%  Prioritised concurrent execution of two programs may terminate if both
%%  programs may terminate.
final(pconc(D1,D2),S) :-
    final(D1,S), final(D2,S).

%%  Concurrent iteration of a program may terminate in any situation, as
%%  it may be executed zero times.
final(cstar(_),_).

%%  A procedure call may terminate if the corresponding body, with arguments
%%  substituted appropriately, may terminate.
final(pcall(PArgs),S) :-
    sub(now,S,PArgs,PArgsS), proc(PArgsS,P), final(P,S).

%%  An offline search can terminate if the program to be searched can
%%  terminate.
final(search(D),S) :-
    final(D,S).

%%  A program is also final if it contains syntactic sugar, and is equivalent
%%  to a program that is final.
final(D,S) :-
    syn_sugar(D,Ds),
    final(Ds,S).



%%
%%  trans(D,S,Dp,Sp):  program transition is possible
%%
%%  The predicate trans/4 is true when it is possible for situation S
%%  to evolve to situation Sp by executing the first part of program D.
%%  Dp is the part of D that remains to be executed in situation Sp.
%%
%%  Thus, trans/4 defines how execution of a program may be single-stepped
%%  from one situation to another.  The specifics of each individual
%%  clause are explained below.
%%

%%  It is never legal to transition an empty program, hence there
%%  is no clause for this case.

%%  A program consisting of a single (possibly concurrent) action may
%%  transition in several ways, depending on the natural actions which
%%  may occur in situation S.
%%
%%  * If situation S has no LNTP, perform the action at any time and
%%    set Dp to the empty program
%%  * If situation S has an LNTP, there are three possible transitions:
%%      * If the action has no natural actions and it is possible to
%%        do it before the LNTP, do so and set Dp to the empty program
%%      * Do the natural actions at the predicted time, leaving the
%%        program unaltered
%%      * Do the given action and the natural actions concurrently
%%        at the LNTP, and set Dp to the empty program
