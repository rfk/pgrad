Points, in order:

1.  Not from any single body of work, our perception of how things are

2. Indeed.  Cut for space reasons

3. Again.

4. Again, space reasons only - the most compact of the transition
   predicates were selected.

5. The aim was not to describe in details how the execution could be
   distributed, but to hint at the possibilites offered by the Golog
   approach. Because of the logic-based semantics, existing methods
   for distributed logic programming (such as the Mozart parellel
   search operator) can be used "for free".

   Hmmm...need to say more here.

Overall, very helpful review.
