Many excellent comments on notation and formalisms.  Unfortunately
we had to try to strike a balance between giving a detailed
treatment of existing Golog work and making our work accessible to
a general audience within it space available.  We are confident that the
improvements you suggest can be incorporated without complicating the
flow of the paper.

Regarding natural actions such as ring_timer(), these are not initiated
by the agent but may appear in the program so that agents will wait
for their occurance.  If they are not explicitly included in the program,
the agents will still plan for their occurance.

You make an excellent point with your emptyFridge() example, however we
did not want to complicate matters further by introducing more types
of action.  This could be accounted for in the programs using
if(fridgeFull(now),emptyFridge,nil) to only perform the action if it is
required.  One program would execute the action, the other would find that
it no longer needs to.

Re: \geq vs > in the Trans() axioms, you are correct that this has 
undesirable implications and it will be fixed.

The semantics do not attempt to maximise concurency, however the ordering
of clauses in our implementation is designed to try the true-concurrency
option first.

Response about distributed execution handled with first reviewer.

Thanks for a very helfpul review!
