Welcome</A>
</H1>

<P>
Welcome to the world of postgraduate studies in Computer Science and
Software Engineering.
It is a world full of excitement, challenge, and innovation, and it
is our hope that you will enter it, thrive within it, and eventually emerge
from it with the skills and enthusiasm to last a lifetime of
employment in the discipline of computing, be it in industry or academia.

<P>
Being a postgraduate student is a form of apprenticeship, and
supervising a postgraduate one of the most demanding of all teaching
tasks.
There are many hurdles to be crossed, and in every candidacy there
will be setbacks that must be coped with, for both supervisor and
student.
This document is intended to answer some of the myriad of day-to-day
questions that are the bane of the postgraduate student, and,
perhaps, help some of those setbacks to be avoided.
Postgraduate students--and their staff supervisors--are encouraged
to read this document periodically.
Suggestions for improvement are also welcome,
and will be to the benefit of future post-graduates.

<P>
Note that this document is of an advisory nature only,
and does not have the status of regulation.
The Head of Department is directly answerable to the Vice-Chancellor
for all activity within the department, including postgraduate affairs.

<P>

Structure of the Department</A>
</H4>

<P>
There are three broad groups of staff in the department.

<P>
The academic staff undertake the public function of the department,
the teaching and research.
Academic staff also contribute in a variety of other ways,
by sitting on University or Faculty committees;
by participating in school curriculum design;
by acting as external examiners for other  departments;
and by acting as consultants to business and industry.

<P>
In these endeavours the
academic staff are supported by the office staff and the technical staff.
The office staff provide an enormous amount of
``behind the scenes'' administrative support;
the technical staff a commensurate amount of hardware and software support.
The current office staff are 
Jon Callandar (Department Manager)
Julien Reid (Administrative Manager),
Pinoo Bharucha (Administrative Officer), 
Binh Phan (Administrative Assistant), 
Louise Walker (Undergraduate Programs Manager),
Vanessa Smith (Academic Programs Officer),
and
Cindy Sexton (Safety Officer).

<P>
Postgraduate students are also an integral part of the department,
and form a fourth important group.
Without them the department could not function.
It is important that students understand the role they play in the
activities of the department, and they should be prepared to
contribute--by organising social events and seminars; by participating
in discussion on matters such as curriculum; 
by providing teaching support for undergraduate classes;
and by providing a focus
for the research activity of the department.
As apprentice academics, postgraduate students can do much to create 
a lively, spirited, and productive environment.

<P>
All of the academic staff report directly to the Head of Department
(Professor Rao Kotagiri, <code>rao</code>).
Postgraduate students are managed as a group by the Postgraduate
Coordinator (James Bailey, <code>jbailey</code>)
and individually by their supervisors.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00040020000000000000">
The supervisor</A>
</H4>

<P>
Of all of the staff, the most important to each postgraduate
is their supervisor (or, in some cases, supervisors).
In many cases the supervisor will become a friend as well as a
colleague, and it is important that the right choice be made at the
commencement of the candidature.
It is relatively easy to change supervisor at the beginning of the
candidature, but increasingly harder as the candidature progresses.
Students who are unhappy with their supervisor should discuss the
matter with the postgraduate coordinator at the earliest opportunity.

<P>
The supervisor should treat the student as a valued member of the
department and as a research colleague.
Through the good work of students the reputation of the supervisor is
enhanced, and good research will inevitably lead to joint publication
of research results, in many cases far more so than had the
supervisor spent the equivalent amount of their own time working
alone.
Postgraduate students act as a multiplier, and should be welcomed and
sought after by potential supervisors.

<P>
It is a general University policy that no staff member should be
supervising more than seven full-time equivalent research students, including
honours-level undergraduates.
Moreover, this limit assumes that students are at different stages of
their candidacy, as different demands are placed upon the supervisor
at different times.
The upper limit of seven EFTSU 
is enforced by the postgraduate selection
committee, and prospective students should be aware that 
supervisors may at times be fully committed
and unable to accept further students.

<P>
A large amount of written material is available about the
student-supervisor relationship, and how it can be established
soundly to the benefit of both parties.
One such document (``How to be a Good Graduate Student/Graduate
Student Advisor'') is attached to the print version of this document.
It is also possible for supervisors to attend ``Supervision of
Postgraduate Students'' courses at the Centre for the Study of Higher
Education.
Indeed, students might reasonably ask their supervisor when last
they attended such a course.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00040030000000000000">
The advisory committee</A>
</H4>

<P>
In addition to a primary supervisor each student
will be assigned a non-technical advisory committee to
monitor their progress and provide non-technical
assistance.
The structure of these committees is described in
Section&nbsp;<A HREF="#sec-stages">8</A> below.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00040040000000000000">
Communication</A>
</H4>

<P>
Representatives for the postgraduate students meet occasionally with
senior staff to canvass general postgraduate issues.
Such meetings will usually be advertised in advance by mail, together
with an invitation for agenda items.

<P>
The department has regular staff meetings, where various organisational and
academic matters are discussed.  Postgraduates are represented at these
meetings by one or two students (who are periodically voted in at CSSEPG
meetings when the positions become vacant).  The postgraduate members can 
raise issues on behalf of students, and are also present to provide the
postgraduate perspective on issues that may arise.  They may
communicate with the CSSEPG president on matters arising from these meetings
that may be relevant to postgraduate students in general.  
If you have any issues or concerns, contact Gavin Baker (<code>gavinb</code>),
Room 3.25a, phone 8344-1424.

<P>
Students may at any time seek appointments with the postgraduate
coordinator or, for serious matters, the Head of Department.

<P>

Facilities</A>
</H1>

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00050010000000000000">
Safety</A>
</H4>

<P>
All post-graduate students must undergo a safety induction. This is
usually performed by the Safety Officer, Cindy Sexton, but it is the
responsibility of your supervisor to make sure that it happens.
Read our building's Safety Manual (follow the link from 
<TT><A NAME="tex2html3"
  HREF="http://www.dis.unimelb.edu.au/EHS/">http://www.dis.unimelb.edu.au/EHS/</A></TT>)
and get to know its safety rules and evacuation routes.
If you identify a hazardous situation in or around the building,
please notify Vicki Jackson (8344-1507), the Building Emergency Controller. 
Also read the section about occupational overuse syndrome (OOS) or
repetitive strain injury (RSI) at
<TT><A NAME="tex2html4"
  HREF="http://www.engr.unl.edu/ee/eeshop/rsi.html">http://www.engr.unl.edu/ee/eeshop/rsi.html</A></TT>, and evaluate your work
practices in light of this information. Adjusting bad posture and typing
practice now could well save you an immense amount of problems later.  

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00050020000000000000">
Building facilities</A>
</H4>

<P>
The ICT building includes a wide range of facilities.
There are many meeting rooms for small groups of people.
These rooms may be booked by students for work-related meetings.
There are also smaller seminar rooms, usually used
for fourth year lectures.
These may be used for meetings of up to about 20 people.
Booking is online through 
<TT><A NAME="tex2html5"
  HREF="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/roombooking/">http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/roombooking/</A></TT>.

<P>
The building contains a number of tutorial rooms and lecture theatres.
These may also be booked for student use, but semester-time usage is
normally very high.
The administration of these rooms is through the central room
bookings system, and so considerable lead time (at least a week) is
normally required.
The office will make the necessary contact with central reservations;
contact Julien in the first instance.

<P>
Postgraduate office allocations are handled by Julien, in
consultation with the supervisor of each student.
Julien also handles key-cards and office keys; new students should,
upon arrival, present themselves to Julien to arrange these
housekeeping details.
A deposit is usually required for all keys issued; this will be
returned when students hand back their keys at the completion of their degree.

<P>
Research postgraduate students can use the level 4 staff room and the
small tea-making rooms around the building.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00050030000000000000">
Parking</A>
</H4>

<P>
Students are not entitled to daytime parking permits unless there are
medical reasons.
Public parking is available at the University Square car park.
Enter either from Berkeley Street, or from Bouverie Street.
After-hours parking is permitted; students may purchase a yearly
after-hours parking permit from the Traffic Office near the Richard
Berry Building.
Contact the Traffic Office for further details.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00050040000000000000">
Working hours</A>
</H4>

<P>
The usual working hours (that is, hours of unrestricted access to the
building) are nominally 9am to 5pm, Monday to Friday.
There is no restriction on work outside these hours, but students are
cautioned that approximately 40 hours per week of research-related
study is required, and that the key to achieving this is regular
working hours.
Tutoring duties, and other outside interests such as sport and social
clubs, should not be considered to be part of the ``business'' of
being a postgraduate student.

<P>
Four weeks annual leave is permitted each year, but students should
consult with their supervisor before taking the leave.
Absence through illness of less than a week does not require a
doctor's certificate, but longer illness should be substantiated by
medical evidence.
Holders of scholarships should note any leave conditions that apply
to their awards.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00050050000000000000">
Emergencies</A>
</H4>

<P>
Students should familiarise themselves with emergency procedures.
Any emergency should be reported to Security on extension 46666.
Building related emergencies should be notified to Maintenance,
or by using extension 46000.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00050060000000000000">
Security</A>
</H4>

<P>
There have been regular
thefts of personal belongings and departmental equipment
from the building.
There is also a risk of arson or other malicious
damage, which could destroy large amounts
of research effort.
To minimise these undesirable events, all members of the
department are asked to observe a few simple precautions:

<P>

<UL>
<LI>Keep all room doors locked when the room is not occupied by a
person who is in a position to observe the entry from all doors of casual
or unauthorised visitors.  Ensure 
that all doors into corridors are left locked at lunch time.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Never prop open doors, or leave doors unlocked, to ``let in friends''.
Similarly, do not let into the building people who purport
to be ``the friends of Fred''.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Question all strangers you see in the building, particularly at
lunch time or after 5pm, or at the weekend.  
If you notice unusual activities in the department let the General
Office staff know immediately.  
Outside normal hours ring the Security Office on extension 46666 
(for urgent assistance/advice 24 hours).
Students should avoid confrontational situations with
unwanted ``guests'', as this is the job of the Security Office.
Students should phone  the Security Advice line on extension 44674 to
arrange an after-hours ``escort'' to parked cars or tram stops.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Regularly check over the contents of your office. If any
unexpected disappearance of equipment is observed, report the matter
immediately to your supervisor or another staff member.
Prompt reporting of theft is necessary for insurance reasons.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>When leaving your office at the end of the day, turn off the lights
and lock all doors.
When leaving the building after normal hours, if the outside door has
been locked, make sure that it closes properly after you.
</LI>
</UL>
Your personal items are not covered by University insurance.
You can usually add items such as laptops and bicycles to your home
contents insurance.

<P>
Alcohol may not be brought into the department without
the express permission of the Head of Department.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00050070000000000000">
Computing facilities</A>
</H4>

<P>
The department has a diverse computer network, based on UNIX servers
supporting about 600 client machines. Furthermore, the department
provides internet access, dial-in access, file backup, network printing,
system administration and technical support services.
The computer network supports TCP/IP at 100 Mbps. The department network
is connected to the University's network via Gigabit ethernet, and
subsequently to the internet.
Details are available at <TT><A NAME="tex2html6"
  HREF="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/systems/">http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/systems/</A></TT>.

<P>
Most file systems, including <code>/home/pgrad/</code> are mounted on all
general-purpose departmental machines.
Research students are also allocated 
accounts on <code>mulga.cs.mu.oz.au</code>,
which is the main mail machine. Students wishing to receive their mail
on the (undergraduate) mail server <code>queeg.cs.mu.oz.au</code>
will need to place a <code>.forward</code> in their <code>mulga</code> account.
Students requiring access to any special equipment should, in the first
instance, discuss the need with their supervisor.

<P>
The default equipment provided for full-time postgraduate students is a
desk with a colour X-terminal. Postgraduate students have equivalent
access as staff to the servers, and related services, such as email,
newsgroups, printing and dial-up modems.

<P>
Students are required to exercise reasonable care to safeguard their
accounts from break-in, and to protect the equipment in general from
damage.
Students who are detected attempting to crack the system or the
accounts of other users will be dealt with according to the University
discipline regulations.
Students should appreciate that the equipment must be used
collaboratively, and should refrain from activities that affect the
ability of others to use the resources.
What might seem like a harmless prank--sending forged mail, for
example--can often have serious consequences.
University policy is that computers and network equipment may
only be used for University related business.
In particular, offensive images must not be copied, stored, or viewed
on any departmental computers.

<P>
Students must be aware that software is subject to copyright,
and that all software installed onto any of the systems, whether
for public or private use, must be correctly licensed.
Do not download copyrighted songs, movies, or other non-study related
material.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00050080000000000000">
Getting started</A>
</H4>

<P>
You may be allocated an X-terminal or a PC running Windows 2000 or XP.
An X-terminal will be connected to one of the servers.
From a PC you will log on using the samba server.

<P>
To get started, copy the ``generic'' files from 
<code>/local/share/skel/common</code> on <code>mundroo</code>. 
This directory contains the files
(<TT>bash_profile</TT>, 
<TT>cshrc</TT>, <TT>login</TT>, <TT>twmrc</TT>, and
<TT>xrdb</TT>, and probably others as well) 
which can be copied to your home directory to names with
<code>.</code> in front (e.g. <TT>.bash_profile</TT>, <TT>.cshrc</TT>) 
and then be edited as appropriate.

<P>
For text processing most staff and students use L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X.
A simple document to get started may be found on
<code>mundroo</code> in <code>~alistair/latex.starter/sample.tex</code>.
Introductory
classes in the use of L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X are often run as part of the honours year;

also has pointers to L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X resources.
But it is probably a good idea to buy a L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X book rather than rely on
word of mouth expertise.
Good books are <I>L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X: A Document Preparation System, Second Edition</I>,
Leslie Lamport, Addison-Wesley,
<I>The L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X Companion</I>, Michael Goossens, Frank Mittelbach,

<I>The L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X Graphics Companion</I>, Michael Goossens, Sebastian Rahtz, and
Frank Mittelbach.
The corresponding bibliography maintenance program is called
<code>bibtex</code>, and users of L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X should also familiarise themselves
with the use of <code>bibtex</code>.

Students are also encouraged to use the reverse side of such paper for
notes.
On the other hand, one-side-used paper should only be loaded
into the printer trays if you are <EM>sure</EM> that
your job is next in the queue and if you
<EM>promise</EM> both to remove the extra sheets from the printer tray after
your job completes and to clear any paper jams that may result in your job not completing.

School of Graduate Studies</A>
</H4>

<P>
The School of Graduate Studies (SGS) was established in 1993 to
oversee all postgraduate research programmes, and to administer the
Ph.D. degree (the Ph.D. is a degree of the University rather than
of any particular faculty).
It is located in the 1888 building, opposite the northern end of Bouverie
Street.
The School also handles scholarships, both within the University and
as a focal point for information about scholarships elsewhere.
The SGS also provides study facilities, computer equipment, and
publishing facilities for postgraduates.
The University of Melbourne Postgraduate Association (UMPA) is also
housed in the SGS.
Students are encouraged to visit the 1888 building and examine the
wide range of resources offered by these two organisations.
Finally, the SGS also acts as a meeting place, providing
interdisciplinary seminars and social events for postgraduate
students.

<P>
The Postgraduate Bistro is open for extended hours, and offers 
a reasonably-priced venue for meals and snacks at all times of the day.

<P>
Melbourne's University Library provide traditional services including loans, 
reference, interlibrary loans, and online searching.
Most services are available without charge to enrolled students and staff
of the University of Melbourne for purposes of teaching, study and research.
Exceptions are the charges made for interlibrary loans and the printing 
of full-text from online collections.
The library also participates in the CAVAL Reciprocal Borrowing Program,
and you may enrol as borrower (by getting a CAVAL card) at other
participating libraries in Victoria.
Your student card gives you access to all the local resources.

<P>
At the start of each semester the Engineering Library runs introductory
courses on the use of library facilities and online research tools.
If you have not had such an introduction, check with the library when the
next session is run, or ask your Postgraduate Coordinator to arrange a
short course.

<P>
At least four of the branch libraries are of interest to students and 
researchers in Computer Science and Software Engineering:

<UL>
<LI>The Engineering Library is located on the first floor of the 
	Old Engineering Building.
</LI>
<LI>The Mathematical Sciences Branch Library (MSBL)
	is located on the ground floor of the Richard Berry Building.  
</LI>
<LI>The Education Resource Centre (ERC)
	Library is located behind the School of Graduate Studies.
</LI>
<LI>The Baillieu Library is located on the western side of the main campus.
</LI>
</UL>
The Engineering Library is our ``home'' library, and most of the new 
monographs acquired for our discipline end up there.
Also, a great many Computer Science serials come to the Engineering Library,
including all IEEE publications.
If a request cannot be handled online via the University's
web pages (<TT><A NAME="tex2html27"
  HREF="http://www.lib.unimelb.edu.au/">http://www.lib.unimelb.edu.au/</A></TT>), then you would normally go to the
see the friendly staff at the Engineering Library.

<P>
The MSBL was originally run and
funded jointly by the Departments of Mathematics, Statistics, and
Computer Science, without support from the University Library.
Around 1990, the library became part of the University Library, and
the collection was recorded in the University Library's catalogue.
MSBL is of great importance for Computer Science and Software Engineering,
as it holds the largest collection of journals, many conference
proceedings, and the series Lecture Notes in Computer Science.
All serials published by the Association for Computing Machinery end up
in MSBL.

<P>
The ERC has extensive collections, not only in the area of education.
Of interest to us are its special collections in the areas of mathematics
and logic.

<P>
The Baillieu Library has a few Computer Science Journals and an
extensive older collection in areas related to theoretical computer
science, such as logic and computability.

<P>
You can access the University Library's catalogue browsers, such as the
Innopac system, from your terminal.

You may want to bookmark the page you arrive at.
If you click `Key Resources' you will get to a portal for useful
discipline-specific resources, including indexes such as Web of Science

such as digital libraries from the ACM, IEEE, and various publishers.
To access some of these you will be asked
to provide the barcode number from your student card.

<P>
Because of space shortage, not all print resources are on shelves in the
branch libraries.  
Some older material, such as old volumes of Lecture Notes in Computer Science,
and some journals, are kept in storage (for example, CARM, which is in 
Bundoora).
You can order this material, but expect that it will take 4-5 days to
arrive.

  HREF="http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/tcsbs/">http://www.cs.mu.oz.au/tcsbs/</A></TT>.
Note that the regulations for most degrees, and for most
scholarships, place limits upon the amount of outside work that may
be undertaken.
Students should also be aware that casual work can be a drain on
their time and a distraction from their study.
Nevertheless, tutoring an undergraduate class is an important part of
the academic apprenticeship, and postgraduate students are encouraged
to undertake such duties.
Workshops on teaching techniques are organised from time to time, and
postgraduates are urged to attend.
For details of these workshops contact Michael Kirley 
(<code>castute</code>).

<P>
Senior postgraduate students who believe that they will follow an
academic career path may also be invited to take responsibility for
writing and delivery of a small number of lectures in main stream
undergraduate subjects.
Such teaching experience will stand them in good stead when applying
for academic teaching/research positions.
Students wishing to be considered for such offers should make

Research</A>
</H1>

<P>
There is a wide range of literature available that describes the
research process, and mechanisms that can be employed to ensure that
research degrees are approached in a professional and ultimately
successful manner.
The SGS and UMPA both offer guidance in this area; another document
(``How to be a good graduate student/graduate student advisor'') is
attached to the print version of this document.

<P>
In all of this literature there are a few key themes that appear to
be central to a successful candidature, and these are summarised in
this section.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00070010000000000000">
Start early</A>
</H4>

<P>
The clock starts ticking from the first day, and never runs
backwards.
By the end of the degree, with a submission deadline looming and a
scholarship about to expire, most students wish they could have back
some of those lazy summer days of three years before when the major
pressure in each day was to make the appropriate bridge bid.
The fraction of students that have their thesis finished and ready to
submit on the first day of their submission window is vanishingly small.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00070020000000000000">
Be organised</A>
</H4>

<P>
Organise your time, and regard yourself as being employed.
Work regular hours.
Set yourself deadlines, and stick to them.
Find a filing cabinet that you can call your own, and use it.
Make use of a notebook to record plans, dreams, and frustrations.
Writing, even if it is only for your own private consumption, is a
sure way to identify opportunities and weaknesses.
Indeed, writing is sufficiently important that the whole of the next
section is devoted to it.

<P>
Write notes on papers you read, and record them into your bibliography
immediately.
Spending the last two weeks of thesis writing tracking down
page or volume numbers for papers you wish to cite is
very frustrating.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00070030000000000000">
Talk to your supervisor</A>
</H4>

<P>
Supervisors can be elusive, and students reluctant to pin them
down and insist on meetings.
This can be very wasteful.
When you want to talk to your supervisor, don't be fobbed off by
a ``ok, lets do that next week'' answer.
Fix a time for today or tomorrow.

<P>
A good supervisor will also pursue students and demand meetings,
but this is often hard to keep up if the student is evasive
or habitually brings nothing new to meetings.
Most supervisors can easily fill their days with other useful activities,
and
the research programme of each student they supervise
is only a small part of the supervisor's spectrum of
responsibilities.
Students do not have this opportunity to timeslice, since
they often have only one active process.
Entering the ``wait-state'' is counter-productive.

<P>
Meetings might be as often as a few minutes every day,
or as infrequent as an hour once a month.
The need for meetings will also change as the candidacy progresses.
But, without some appropriate
level of support from and interaction with their supervisor, 
most students will become non-productive and dis-enchanted.

<P>
If it reaches the stage
where either party finds that they are relieved when meetings are
cancelled, or cancellation/postponement is a regular occurrence,
then the matter should be brought to the attention of the
postgraduate coordinator.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00070040000000000000">
Keep a record</A>
</H4>

<P>
Supervision meetings should be documented, with an agreed list of
actions and deadlines exchanged after each.
This documentation should also include the agreed time for the next
meeting.
In the discipline of computing,
the desired record is easily achieved by, during the last
few minutes of each meeting, jointly composing some electronic mail
that both parties can retain a copy of.
A notebook serves just as well.
Such a record makes it easy to see whether or not the work is
progressing as planned and whether progress is being made.
It is also an important backup in the unlikely event of some
subsequent dispute arising over the performance of either of the two
parties.

<P>
Experimental work should also be well-documented.
Retain the output of old experimental runs (including a record of
what parameters were set, and what data file was being used, and what
machine you were running on, and etc etc) and old versions of your
programs in a carefully organised and well-documented way.
You never know when you might want to further test something that you
thought was finished with.
One obvious case is when a paper is 12 months in the refereeing
process, and a reviewer comes back to you and asks for another column of
values in a table, or for clarification of what the experimental data was.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00070050000000000000">
Deal with difficulties</A>
</H4>

<P>
The unpleasant things are the hardest to do, so we put them off.
Don't.
If some issue is a potential problem, the earlier it is resolved the
sooner the research programme can be returned to.
Big problems rarely emerge fully grown; they develop out of
small problems.
Small problems should be dealt with as they arise.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00080000000000000000">
Writing</A>
</H1>

<P>
The essence of scholarship is writing.
An academic--student or staff--must regard dissemination
of their research results as being of the utmost importance,
and should concentrate their efforts accordingly.
For a student, the goal is to produce a thesis.
But it is also expected that along the way students will have authored
shorter works--technical reports and papers.
Indeed, the earlier a student falls into the habit of
writing, the more likely it is that they will bring their
candidacy to a timely and successful conclusion.
Writing includes the taking of notes on seminar speakers, 
summarising papers read,
describing experiments undertaken and hypotheses formed,
and the authoring of surveys, tutorials, and annotated bibliographies.
Regular writing is the key to thesis success, and
the importance of this simple act cannot be stressed enough.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00080010000000000000">
Technical reports</A>
</H4>

<P>
A technical report describes newly completed work, or work still
under way. It is often the prelude to more formal publication, and, except for
unusual cases, should not be regarded as an end in itself.
The exceptions are when the technical report contains reference
material that might otherwise be unpublishable, such as an extensive
bibliography, or a manual for a software system.
Except for such cases, it is expected that more formal
publication--in conference proceedings and then, ultimately, in
archival form in a journal of record--will be pursued.

<P>
The departmental technical report series has been terminated.
If you wish to make available unpublished work
you can either organise it to be available through
your homepage, or if you want to have it widely accessible
and date stamped, you can place it in an archive like CoRR
at <TT><A NAME="tex2html33"
  HREF="http://arxiv.org/archive/cs/intro.html">http://arxiv.org/archive/cs/intro.html</A></TT>.

<P>
Students are required to have the approval of their supervisor before
publishing (even in their own web site) a technical report
including their supervisor as author, and are suggested
to do the same even if the supervisor is not an author.
The work reflects on the
reputation of the department as a whole as well as that of the
authors, and supervisors should act as referees to guard this
reputation.
Authors should also consider approaching external experts for
opinions before finalising the contents of technical reports.

<P>
The department does not have a policy on 
the question of on-line access to technical reports.
On one hand, there is clearly a case for making PostScript (or even
L<SUP><SMALL>A</SMALL></SUP>T<SMALL>E</SMALL>X source) for reports available on the net--we all benefit
from open access to a wide variety of information, including the
technical reports of other people.
However there is also an argument in favour of confidentiality.
Proponents of non-open access argue that the essence of
``publishing'' is exclusivity, and that in making material available
via the net, authors are effectively preempting the traditional
publication process.
They conclude that publishers might quite legitimately refuse to
accept an otherwise good-quality paper that has been net-published if
the author is unable to transfer an exclusive copyright to the
publishing house.
For an extended exposition of this viewpoint,
see the article in the April 1995 <EM>Communications of the ACM</EM> on the matter.
The ACM recently relaxed their rather strict viewpoint,
and now allow limited electronic dissemination of in-submission papers,
see
    <TT><A NAME="tex2html34"
  HREF="http://www.acm.org/pubs/copyright_policy/">http://www.acm.org/pubs/copyright_policy/</A></TT>for further details.

<P>
In an ideal world we would not require or seek the intervention of
publishers, and this is why there are so many useful Web pages
available.
The world is, however, not ideal, and academics rely upon formal
publication of their work for appointment, promotion, and research
grant purposes.
One sensible compromise is to ``publish'' a textual abstract of
technical reports and submitted papers as a web page and inviting
interested parties to enter into email or postal correspondence to
obtain a full (paper or electronic) copy of the document.
This has the advantage of advertising the work to the net-community
at large, but, because the dissemination of the copies is controlled,
not affecting the eventual desire to transfer copyright to a
publisher.
Parties who receive electronic copies after an explicit request will
usually agree to some form of limiting behaviour.
For example, it is not unreasonable to mail people PostScript of
your work, but request them to delete the file immediately upon
printing it.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00080020000000000000">
Writing papers</A>
</H4>

<P>
More formal presentation of some piece of work is achieved by
submitting a paper for publication.
In computing the usual forum for presentation of new results is at a
conference; such presentation establishes a ``place-holder'' in the
community, which should, in most specialisations, be followed up by a
``journal version'' of the paper in which all proofs are complete,
all experimental results explained, and all feedback, queries, and
criticisms (from readers of the conference version) accounted for.
Only when innovative work is described in a journal paper should it
be deemed to be ``completed'' and ``on the record''.

<P>
For students, the long turnaround time from initial submission to
final publication (as long as two, three, or four year) makes journal
papers hard to achieve.
Conference papers have faster turnaround, usually about six months from
submission to ``publication'', but the refereeing process is more
variable, and the distribution of the proceedings often quite
limited.
Thus, it is often the case that conference papers are prepared during
the candidacy, and journal papers after thesis
submission.
(Some scholarships offer the opportunity of ``writing-up'' extensions
after thesis submission.
Contact the SGS for details.)

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00080030000000000000">
Conferences</A>
</H4>

<P>
Consequent upon acceptance of a paper at a conference is the need for
at least one of the authors to attend that conference.
Note that if no author plans to attend, the paper should not have
been submitted, and submission is an implicit undertaking that if the
paper is accepted, at least one author will attend.
Discuss the issue of attendance--and funding to cover the cost of
that attendance--<EM>before</EM> submitting the paper.

<P>
Attendance at the right
conferences is an important component of the research
process.
It is at conferences that one hears of new developments in other
research groups that have not yet even been written up; that one
meets potential employers; and that one can be exposed to the
research work of others, which will inevitably provide new insights
to the benefit of one's own project.
Conferences also provide extensive opportunity for social interaction
with one's colleagues, and this is increasingly important as more and
more research activity takes place through the wonders of the
Internet.
It is not at all unusual to co-author papers with people that you
have never met; nevertheless, such collaborations are cemented by
face to face meetings.

<P>
Attendance at the wrong conferences is a waste of time and money.
Don't submit papers to conferences just because they are in
interesting locations or near your family; and in particular don't
put together a paper and send it to a conference just because you
received what appears to be a personalised invitation to submit work.
Aim for the very best conferences, and ignore the never-ending stream
of third-rate events that accept third-rate papers.
Remember always that a publication record is judged on quality more
than on quantity; and one paper in a recognised international journal
or first-class conference counts for five wishy-washy ones.
The litmus test to apply is always this: ``Will a copy of the work
automatically make it back to the University library?''
If the answer is ``no'', chances are that the people you would like
to see your work--similar-minded people at other institutions who
rely on their library for support--will remain oblivious of it, and
you have wasted your time.

<P>
Nevertheless, introducing a student to their network of colleagues is
one of the most important tasks a supervisor must perform, and
conferences are the ideal venue for this.
With this in mind, early in the candidature supervisor and student
should identify the important conferences for the speciality, and
make long-term plans for submission of papers and for attendance.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00080060000000000000">
Authorship</A>
</H4>

<P>
One question that sometimes becomes vexatious when written work is
being prepared is that of authorship.
In general, published work that is generated during the course of a
postgraduate degree will usually be as a result of joint intellectual
effort and so will be jointly authored by student and supervisor.
It will often be the case that the student has undertaken the bulk,
if not all, of the ``chore'' of capturing some idea on paper and
creating the actual document that describes that idea; and it might
also be the case that they have undertaken all of the
implementation and experimentation phases of the investigation.
Nevertheless, it is also usually true that the supervisor has
substantially contributed to the conception of the investigation and
given ongoing advice as to its execution.
It is thus usual for supervisor and student to share the credit for
the work, especially during the early stages of candidacy, with the
ordering of the authors reflecting the extent to which the two
parties contributed to the work.

<P>
There may also be cases in which sole authorship, or joint authorship
amongst a group of students is appropriate.
This might occur during the latter stages of a candidacy when the
student can be expected to be in contact with other experts in the
field.
Nevertheless, all involved supervisors should be consulted prior to
submission; and it may be that further improvements in the quality of
the submitted paper are the result of such consultation.
Disputes over authorship should be raised with the postgraduate
coordinator or the Head of Department if they cannot be resolved
amicably in this way.

<P>
For their part, supervisors should read drafts of
papers promptly, provide input as to presentation and style, and
write components of the paper as appropriate.
Notwithstanding any of the suggestions made above, supervisors are
expected to collaborate with their student co-authors in the same
cooperative manner as they would with staff co-authors.
Moreover, co-authorship must <EM>always</EM> be
a return for a genuine contribution to the
intellectual property embodied in a paper, and simply being the supervisor
of a postgraduate student, or being responsible in some way for
generating the research funding that supports that student, is, of
itself, certainly <EM>not</EM> a reason for research work undertaken
by the student to be attributed jointly.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00080070000000000000">
Approval</A>
</H4>

<P>
All submissions for publication should be approved by the supervisor.
Similarly, supervisors should not submit papers based upon work
undertaken by a student without the approval of the student, even if
the student is listed as a co-author.
In rare cases it may be that student and supervisor disagree over the
worth of some piece of written work (be it sole or joint authorship);
in this case the dispute should be referred to the postgraduate
coordinator, who will seek further input and make a recommendation to
the Head of Department.

It is most important that a practice talk be given to a small group

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00080090000000000000">
Theses</A>
</H4>

<P>
The final thesis is somewhat different from the rest of the written
work produced during a candidacy; it is the work primarily of the
student, and authorship is sole.
This raises difficult issues for both student and supervisor.
The student must clearly indicate which of the original ideas were
provided by the supervisor at the commencement of the project, and
which are claimed as the result of the project itself.
The supervisor is often torn between a desire to improve the quality
of the thesis, and the need for the student to write their own work.
The degree to which supervisors proofread and
correct the detail of the thesis is
variable, but supervisors should remember that examiners will be
scornful of poorly presented work, and that the scorn will 
extend to the supervisor as well as the student.
Students who know that they have difficulty
with written expression should consider
using (and paying for privately) the services of a professional proofreader.

<P>
One reasonable requirement is that a supervisor not be expected to read
more than two drafts of any particular chapter.
Students should also appreciate that providing critical comment can take
time and should plan their production schedule accordingly so that
they do not further refine some section while the supervisor believes
it to be ``frozen''.
It is annoying to spend a week reading a thesis
chapter in detail marking grammatical and presentational changes, only
to be told, upon returning it to the student, to ``never mind, I have just
printed another draft of that chapter for you with new results''.
For their part, supervisors should read material in a timely manner--one
week to read a thesis chapter is reasonable, one month is not.

<P>
When the thesis is complete, the supervisor and Head of Department
are required to sign a declaration
that the thesis is ready to be sent for examination.
This is an important requirement, and should not be taken lightly.
Students should not dismiss suggestions from their supervisor as being
nitpicky, or too demanding; they may enter into debate as to the need
for suggested changes, but should not arbitrarily ignore such requests.

<P>
At first submission theses may usually be in temporary bindings.
Formatting requirements may
include restrictions on word or page counts, the width of
page borders, the amount of interline spacing, etc.
The details of these requirements change from time to time and from
degree to degree, and it is important that students seek information
from the 
School of Graduate Studies
well before the proposed submission date.
Finding out such information is the responsibility of the student,
not the supervisor.

<P>
Some scholarships provide for reimbursement of thesis expenses,
and sometimes even for professional proofreading.
Students on scholarships should be sure to determine the level of
such reimbursement, and any stipulated conditions that may be
attached.
Departmental facilities may be used for the preparation and printing
of theses, but students should note that in some cases final
submitted theses should be on acid-free or other special paper types,
and the cost of this paper must be met by the student.
The student is also responsible for binding costs.

<P>
There is a wide range of written material available to help the
thesis writing task, and students should actively seek such material
by visiting the relevant Faculty Office, the School of Graduate
Studies, and the Postgraduate Union.

Application</A>
</H4>

<P>
Application forms for postgraduate degrees are available from the
departmental office, from the relevant faculty office, or from the
School of Graduate Studies.
Applications from permanent residents should be lodged with the
departmental office, and will be accepted and processed at any time
during the year.
Students seeking scholarships should note that a postgraduate
application should be lodged by the time the scholarship application
is lodged; the main close-off date for Australian resident
scholarships (APA's and resident MRS) is usually around the end of
October each year.
It is also possible to apply for a bridging MRS at
other times of the year, but there are relatively few of these
offered and, as a rule of thumb, they are only available to students who would clearly have been awarded an APA or a MRS in the main round.

<P>
Overseas students should apply through the International Office;
the closing date for overseas postgraduate research scholarships (IPRSs)
is usually in mid September.
Overseas students may also be eligible for MIRS/MIFRS scholarships.
For details of scholarships, closing dates, and conditions,
prospective applicants (including currently enrolled postgraduates)
are urged to seek definitive information from the SGS
well before the anticipated closing dates.

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00090020000000000000">
Selection</A>
</H4>

<P>
Applications for entry and for conversion are considered by the 
departmental Research Postgraduate Selection Committee, at the time
of writing Alistair Moffat,
Zoltan Somogyi, Harald S&#248;ndergaard, and Leon Sterling.
Taken into account are the previous record of undergraduate study;
level and quality of 
prior postgraduate study; publications;
relevant work experience;
the relationship between the proposed project
and the research interests of the department; the capacity of the staff
involved in the proposed area to supervise further postgraduates;
and the endorsement provided by the potential supervisor,
if one has been arranged.
The latter is especially helpful in considering applications:
if the committee can see that a potential supervisor is interested in
the student and prepared to endorse the project,
acceptance is much more likely.

<P>
Students (and staff) should be aware that individual staff members
may not ``accept'' students or agree to supervise them; they may only
discuss projects and endorse an application.
Acceptance is made at the Faculty level, after the Head of Department
makes a recommendation to the Faculty (or SGS, or International
Office).
This misunderstanding has at times led to difficulty; no student may
commence work in the department until an application has been fully
processed through the appropriate channels, irrespective of whether
or not a tentative supervision agreement has been reached with a
staff member.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00090030000000000000">
Enrolment</A>
</H4>

<P>
Once accepted, the relevant Faculty will communicate with the student in
regard to enrolment formalities.
Queries with regard to these formalities should be
made to the appropriate governing authority:
The Faculty of Engineering for M.Comp.Sc. and M.Eng.Sc. students,
the Faculty of Science for M.Sc. students,
the School of Graduate Studies for Ph.D. students,
and the International Office for all overseas students.
Research degrees may be commenced at any stage during the year,
although it is expected that there will be an influx of new students
in February and March.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00090040000000000000">
Advisory committees</A>
</H4>

<P>
All students enrolled in research degrees
have an advisory committee consisting of their
supervisor and at least one other academic adviser.
The purpose of these committees is to assist and monitor postgraduate
students' studies.

<P>
A Ph.D. student's advisory committee comprises the student's
supervisor and two other academics.
A masters student's advisory committee comprises the student's
supervisor and one other academic.
Masters students who already have two supervisors do not need another
academic adviser.
Ph.D. students who already have two supervisors need only one other
academic adviser.
In each case, the supervisor is the chair of the committee.

<P>
Students, in consultation with their supervisor, should approach
suitable staff after they commence their study.
The committee members need not be within the same speciality as the
student and supervisor; the intention is that they be available to
provide general procedural input, and a safeguard against breakdown
of the student-supervisor relationship.
Once finalised, details of the proposed arrangement should be lodged
with the office for approval by the postgraduate committee.

<P>
It is important to stress that advisory committees supplement the
well established procedures currently in place for the management of
masters and Ph.D. candidatures.
The committees do not reduce the importance of the supervisor-student
relationship, which the department considers to be key to all masters
and Ph.D. candidatures.
The student's supervisor remains as the student's main adviser and
first point of contact on all matters regarding the student's
research programme and the student's interaction with the department.
The Head of Department is ultimately responsible to
the School of Graduate Studies and the University 
for the candidature of all graduate students in the department.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00090050000000000000">
Progress meetings</A>
</H4>

<P>
Ph.D. and masters students (part-time and full-time) will be required
to meet with their advisory committee every six months
during the first year of candidature, and at least every twelve
months after that.
At this time, a standard form, which will summarise the student's
progress, will be signed by the student and the committee and kept
for departmental records.
The advisory committee may also be required to meet at other times,
as appropriate.
For example, masters students applying for conversion to Ph.D. enrolment should discuss their application with their advisory
committee prior to lodging their application (see the next
paragraph).

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00090060000000000000">
Conversion</A>
</H4>

<P>
Unless they have already completed a substantial research degree
(usually supported by publications in appropriate conferences or
journals) students will, in the first instance, be accepted as
masters level candidates.
After nine months of enrolment students may then
apply for their enrolment to be converted to confirmed
Ph.D. candidature, which, if approved, is normally backdated to the 
date of masters enrolment.

<P>
Conversion/confirmation is not a formality.
You will need to prepare an application and arrange, together with
your supervisor, a time for your advisory/confirmation committee to
meet with you.
It is a good idea to get the application form after 6 months, to
get a better understanding of the requirements.

<P>
Your application will be assessed by your
Advisory Committee against the same criteria as new Ph.D. applications,
and the support of the supervisor is required.
The application must include a progress report of about 3000 words
written by you.
The report should include

<OL>
<LI>A clear definition of the problem you are trying to solve;
</LI>
<LI>An explanation of why the problem is important;
</LI>
<LI>A comprehensive literature survey describing all relevant work so far
related to your research problem, placing your work in the context of
others' and describing how your work goes beyond previous work;
</LI>
<LI>Research results so far - preferably with reference to publications by you
or to papers submitted for publication. 
</LI>
<LI>Future research plan - investigations, experiments and writing that you 
plan to do, with rough time-lines.
</LI>
<LI>A 2-3 page summary of the above. The summary will be sent to the 
School of Graduate Studies.
</LI>
</OL>
If conversion is to be recommended by the Head of Department, the
advisory committee will be required to state that you have
made good progress, and that the project is capable
of leading to the award of a Ph.D.

<P>
Conversion should not be regarded as a method for students to avoid the need
to face up to a lack of progress in a masters degree during their
first year of candidature.
Most years there are cases of rejected confirmation applications, so you
need to have a plan in place for the completion of your Masters program,
in case conversion is not approved.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00090070000000000000">
Confirmation</A>
</H4>

<P>
Students who enrol directly into the Ph.D. degree will be granted
probationary candidature initially.
After nine months of enrolment they must apply to have
their candidature confirmed.
This is effectively the same process as conversion from masters to
Ph.D. candidature, and similar standards will be applied.
Ph.D. students who do not apply for confirmation will have their
enrolment terminated.

<P>
For confirmation you will be required to give a postgraduate seminar.
This <I>must</I> be advertised at least 2 weeks in advance
and explicitly advertised as a <I>confirmation seminar</I>.
You should make sure that your advisory committee can attend.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00090080000000000000">
Length of candidature</A>
</H4>

<P>
Students should be aware that the University is becoming increasingly
strict about the duration of research degrees.
Extension beyond the prescribed time period is possible, but by no
means automatic, and will requires a reason more convincing than ``I
need more time''.

<P>
Scholarship holders in particular should be aware of the great
difficulties they will face should they prolong their candidature
beyond the life of their funding.

<P>
Students are thus urged to regularly remind themselves of their
expected completion date, to read the regulations for their degree
(copies are available in the departmental office), and to memorise
the date that their scholarship expires.

<P>
Normal duration of a Ph.D. is three years, with one (and in
exceptional cases, two) six month extension possible; the M.Sc. is a
12&nbsp;month degree with an absolute maximum of 24&nbsp;months; and the
M.Eng.Sc. is a 12&nbsp;month degree, with an absolute maximum of 18&nbsp;months.
Extensions beyond these limits will normally only be granted
on medical grounds
where extended periods of incapacity can be proven.
All of these times should be doubled for part-time candidates.
Applications for extension must be in writing, and require the
endorsement of both the supervisor and the postgraduate coordinator.
If the end of a specified candidature is reached without such
application being received the candidature will automatically lapse.

<P>

<H4><A NAME="SECTION00090090000000000000">
Seminars</A>

<P>
All postgraduate students are required to present a seminar

presentations may count that as their annual seminar.
Usually these presentations are given in the Friday series of
post-graduate seminars.
All postgaduate seminars are announced at

Thesis examination</A>
</H4>

<P>
Towards the end of each candidature the administering faculty will
request that the department supply the names of examiners.

<P>
The examination committee for masters theses normally consists of two
examiners, one of whom may be from inside the Department (but not the
supervisor) and one external examiner who must be from outside the
department.
In the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering the usual 
practice is to appoint two examiners from outside the Department.
External examiners may be in Australia, or may be overseas.
Students may often informally discuss potential examiners with their
supervisor, but final responsibility for selecting an examination
committee rests with the Head of Department.
There is no requirement or provision for oral examination or thesis
defence.

<P>
The examination committee for Ph.D. theses consists of three
examiners.
The first will normally be an overseas expert in the subject area of
the thesis.
The second examiner is required to be outside the University,
but not necessarily outside Australia.
These two examiners are first asked to provide reports on the thesis.
In the event of the examiners returning recommendations that differ
markedly, the third examiner is called in to arbitrate.
This third examiner is, however, selected at the same time as the
first two examiners, and again must have no connection with the
University.
Students are invited to submit a list of people (with reasons) that
they would prefer not be asked to examine their thesis, but
the actual identity of the selected examiners is kept confidential.
As for masters level theses, there is no provision for oral
examination of the candidate.

<P>
Once the reports have been received and an outcome decided, copies of
the reports are given to the candidate, and if the recommendation is
to accept the thesis, the candidate will be invited to submit a final
bound version of their thesis.
At this time the candidate will also be advised either of the names
of the examiners, or, if the examiners do not wish their names
divulged, of this fact.

<P>

Part-time candidature</A>

In the experience of the department it is very difficult for
part-time candidates to undertake research degrees, and the nature of
the proposed candidature is taken into account during the selection
process.
Nevertheless, there are also situations in which part-time candidate is
appropriate, or when conversion from full-time candidature is
necessary.
Part-time students should be especially aware of the need to make
steady progress in their investigation 
and to keep in good contact with their supervisor.
