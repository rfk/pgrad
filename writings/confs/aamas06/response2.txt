Comments on the appropriateness of the situation calculus for multi-agents
systems seem unfounded and are in conflict with other reviewers. In strong
support, Reviewer 2 states the extensions are "both interesting and necessary to
bring Golog languages to actual multi-agent settings" and Reviewer 1
"features which I agree with the authors are important for multi-agent
systems". Related work has demonstrated that Golog has promise for
multi-agent systems.

We welcome the suggestion of incorporating team structures, indeed one
author has experience with teamwork (AAMAS04, Rolegraphs). This paper
addresses necessary pre-conditions to using Golog in this way.

We will expand on related work, space permitting.
