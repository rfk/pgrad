We welcome comments that the work is "interesting and necessary to bring
Golog languages to actual multi-agent settings", and will incorporate the
helpful comments to improve the presentation of the paper beyond Reviewer
1's observation that it "is easy to follow".

- Agents explicitly wait for natural actions to occur when included
in the program, but will plan for their occurrence even if not included. 
- Programs can incorporate: if(not(FridgeEmpty(now)),emptyFridge(),nil) to
transition multiple programs with a single action occurrence.
- Regarding \geq vs > in the Trans() axioms, this indeed has undesirable
implications and will be fixed.
- The semantics do not maximise concurrency, however this can be achieved by
appropriate ordering of clauses for Trans(), or employing an optimising
search for legal executions.
