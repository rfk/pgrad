Regarding the "brief mention of parallel distribution of tasks", the main
intent is to show that existing tools for distributed logic programming
easily facilitate this. This allows teams to share the workload of planning
program execution. We will expand this discussion with more details.

We are confident discussion of parallel execution and the editorial
suggestions can be addressed in the camera ready version, following the
helpful suggestion of compressing Section 4.

We welcome comments that "I like the idea behind this paper", "The paper is
easy to follow" and that the work includes "features which I agree [...] are
important for multi-agent systems".
