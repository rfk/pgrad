Your comprehensive list of stylistic and gramatical improvements
is very much appreciated.

While a full explanation of uniform formulae was removed for space
reasons, a reference to an appropriate definition can easily be
added.

Because we are using the single-step regression operator of [2]
rather than the single-pass operator of [1], any formula uniform
in do(a,s) can be  regressed and a seperate notion of "regressable
formulae" is not required. The material in section 2.2 is easily
modified to make this explicit.

Regarding experimental validation, we are currently building a
system for reasoning about multi-agent knowledge that relies
heavily on this technique and will be the main testbed for its
performance in practise.  Initial results are quite promising.
