Dear Professor Ramasamy Uthurusamy,

As the Sponsorship executive of the Australian Computer Society's
Committee for Artificial Intelligence, I would like to inform you that
the Australian AI society is unable to provide travel grants for
researchers to attend other conferences than our own. We unfortunately
do not have resources for this very worthwhile activity.

Yours Sincerely

Lin Padgham
Professor of Artificial Intelligence
Discipline Head: Intelligent Systems
School of Computer Science and Information Technology,
RMIT, Melbourne, Australia.
