The difficulty in obtaining knowledge in the presence of exogenous
actions is indeed a practical hurdle for knowledge in a multi-agent
system.  In the case of "total ignorance" of exogenous actions, very
few things can be known.  By allowing the agents to observe more of
the actions performed by others, knowledge can be achieved about more
fluents, right up to the extreme case of "total awareness" (the standard
account) where the value of all fluents can potentially be known.

We believe the ability to explicitly make such tradeoffs to be a
powerful feature of our approach.

p2) We should more explicitly state that we are working with standard
situation calculus theories of action, as used by Reiter, Levesque et. al.
For space reasons we have been forced to ommit some of these standard
definitions as assumed background knowledge (possibility of concurrent
actions, foundational axioms, s < s' notation, etc)

p4) ObsHist could be made a function for notational convenience, but
its successor state axiom will ensure it has a unique value.

As you note, some issues with parentheses and typos affect the 
meaning of these axioms, particularly the interaction between
exists and implication which should read:

  exists o. Observations(agt,c,s)=o and (o\={} -> X)

The missing conjunct s <= s'' in Unobs() is a careless omission.

These are easily remedied.


p5) (10) simply describes the meaning of P_D.  P_D is always
a uniform formula and as such can be regressed without problem.
