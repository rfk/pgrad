1) Ordinarily, if a fluent can be changed by some action unobservable to
an agent, then the agent will *never* know the value of that fluent - it
must entertain the possibility that it has been changed.  By "monitor the
value of a fluent" we mean "be aware of changes to that fluent's value even
if the action responsible was not observed".  The agent will thus *always*
know the value of such a fluent.

This is achieved by introducing "change notification actions" that alert the
agent to changes in the fluent's value.

2) We are confident that accessibility properties can be imposed in the
same way as the standard model, but have not fully explored this as we
lack space for a detailed exposition

3) The standard account is fully subsumed by our new account. For an
omniscient viewpoint one can still use regression w.r.t the current
sitution s.  While nothing forbid it, for our applications we see no
advantage in having two "parallel" accounts of knowledge.

4) Our thoughts as well - this could perhaps be added at the expense of
the "change notification actions" sections and associated musing on
monitornig the value of fluents (which is independent of the main
technical content of the paper).
