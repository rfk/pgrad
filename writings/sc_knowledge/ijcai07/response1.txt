1) Ordinarily, if a fluent can be changed by some action unobservable to
an agent, then the agent will *never* know the value of that fluent - it
must entertain the possibility that it has been changed.  By "monitor the
value of a fluent" we mean "be aware of changes to that fluent's value even
if the action responsible was not observed".  The agent will thus *always*
know the value of such a fluent.

This is achieved by introducing "change notification actions" (sec 3.3)
that alert the agent to changes in a fluent's value.  By including
appropriate change actions, the domain modeler can allow agents to
actively monitor the value of specific fluents.

2) We are confident that accessibility properties will be preserved in
the same way as for the standard model, but have not fully explored this
as we lack space for a detailed exposition

3) The standard account is fully subsumed by our new account. For an
omniscient viewpoint one can still use regression w.r.t the current
situation.  While nothing forbids it, for our applications there would
be no advantage to having two "parallel" accounts of knowledge.

4) We will expand the existing small motivational examples as much 
as possible for the final version, to further illustrate our approach.
