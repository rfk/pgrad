Thank you for your helpful list of suggestions and typos.
Regarding your specific queires:

1,6) We will clarify that we work with standard theories of action
as used by Reiter, Levesque et.al, which must be in a particular form.

3,4) We use both Legal(s) and "possible situation" as a convenient shorthand
for "a sequence of actions, all of which are possible."  The Legal(c,s)
notation is useful in certain extensions to the sitcalc, but we will remove
it for the sake of clarity.

7) There is indeed much more to adding "change actions" in a satisfying
manner than we have space to explore.  However, this idea is independent
of the main technical contribution of the paper.

8) The development of an algorithm calculating P_D forms another entire
paper, so space restrictions force us to treat P_D as a "black box" operator
here.  We will clarify this position and the status of P_D regarding the
following point:

9) Eq10 explains that P_D is equivalent to a formula that universally
quantifies over situations. P_D itself is always a regressible formula
uniform in s, allowing P_D[do(c,s)] to be regressed using standard
techniques.

We will also expand the existing small motivational examples as much 
as possible for the final version, to further illustrate our approach.
