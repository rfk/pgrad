1/6) We should be clearer that we work with the standard theories of action
as used by Reiter, Levesque et.al, which must be in a particular form.

2/5) As you note, several small typos and issues with parentheses need to be
fixed throughout our axioms.

3/4) We use both Legal(s) and "possible situation" as a convenient shorthand
for "a sequence of actions, all of which were possible."  The Legal(c,s)
notation is more useful for extensions dealing with e.g. natural actions,
and could indeed be removed from this paper.

7) There is indeed much more to adding "change actions" in a satisfying
manner than can be explored in such a small section.  However, this idea
is independent of the main technical contribution of the paper (and could
perhaps be removed in favor of an example?)

8) We have avoided detailed explanation of how to calculate P_D because this
is explored in a companion paper.  Due to space restrictions, we are forced
to treat P_D as a "black box" operator here. We will endeavor to
clarify this position and the status of P_D regarding the following point,
which has been raised by several reviewers:

9) While P_D is equivalent (relative to D) to a formula that universally
quantifies over situations, P_D itself is a uniform formula and so can
be regressed using standard techniques.
