The lack of a precise distinction between regressable and uniform
formulae is due to our use of the less common single-step
regression operator of [2] as opposed to the single-pass operator
of [1].  The single-step version can operate on a formula uniform
in do(a,s) even though s is a variable, as it can perform a single
regression step over the action a.  Only the single-pass operator 
requires all situation terms to be rooted at s0.

Since uniform formulae cannot quantify over situations, a formula
uniform in do(a,s) is always single-step regressable.  Regression
is used in precisely this way in Lemma 5 of [2], as well as
throughout our paper.  A separate notion of "regressable formulae"
is thus not needed in this context.

The introductory material in section 2.2 can easily be modified to
make this distinction clearer, with a direct reference to [2].


Regarding the generalization of the proof of Lemma 5 in [2], there
is nothing in the construction of M' that specifically requires s0
to be used - the proof would go through using an arbitrary situation
term.  Thus the the specific instance using s0:

   phi[s0] -> all s : ( s0 < s -> phi[s] )

could just as well be applied to any situation s':

   all s' : (phi[s'] -> all s" : ( s' < s" -> phi[s"]))
