Secretary-Treasurer, IJCAI-07


I write to confirm that regretfully, the  Australian Computer Society's
Committee for Artificial Intelligence and Expert Systems is unable to
assist in funding Ryan Kelly's attendence at the IJCAI-07 conference.

Ryan is a promising young researcher with a deep interest in AI.
Please consider him for the IJCAI Travel Grants program.


Yours Sincerely,
