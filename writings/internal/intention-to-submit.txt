This thesis extends the situation calculus with three powerful new features
for reasoning about rich multi-agent domains: a formalism for knowledge in
asynchronous domains where actions may be hidden from some agents; support
for common knowledge and other complex group-level epistemic modalities; and
a technique for planning the joint execution of a shared task with a partial
ordering of the actions to be performed.  Each new feature is firmly grounded
in the standard effective reasoning techniques of the situation calculus.
