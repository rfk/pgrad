\begin{itemize}
\item motivating example: cooking agents
\item introduce HLP paradigm, briefly argue in its favour
\item major limitation: focused on single-agent systems
\item the "MIndiGolog Vision": cooperative execution of a HLP
\item secondary aim: general-purpose tools for HLP in multi-agent domains
\item achievements in this thesis:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item MIndiGolog: HLP semantics suitable for multi-agent domains
  \item New reasoning technique for univsersally quantified queries
  \item Robustly multi-agent account of knowledge, common knowledge
  \item Semantics and techniques for cooperative planning of a legal execution
  \item Techniques for online execution using "social laws" coordination
  \item Implementations in Oz with distributed execution planning
  \end{itemize}
