\section{What is Planning?}
\begin{itemize}
\item In this setting, it is the process of \epmh{resolving nondeterminism}
\item Planning should produce a program for the agent to follow, that does
not itself require deliberation to perform. \cite{levesque96what_is_planning,giacomo04sem_delib_indigolog}
\item Must account for outcomes of sensing actions - some sort of branch/case statement
\item Must be epistemically feasible (show formalisation from \cite{giacomo04sem_delib_indigolog}
\end{itemize}

\section{What is Team Planning?}
\begin{itemize}
\item Must produce a plan for each agent
\item Plans must include the necessary coordination
\item Our own formalisation
\end{itemize}

\section{Resolving Non-Determinism}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hard Problem: removing only as much non-determinism as necessary
\item Easier Problem: re-inserting non-determinism where possible
\item Idea:  plan by first \emph{completely} resolving nondeterminism, but
maintain auxiliary information that allows actions to be interleaved where
a legal execution is maintained.
\end{itemize}
