(this will largely be an expansion of my conference paper on this topic \cite{kelly07sc_know_obs}, with additional work on Common Knowledge)

\section{Hidden Actions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Expand discussion from Background section
\item Define notion of observations, observation history
\item (TODO: try to come up with a less loaded term than "observation"
\end{itemize}

\section{The Knowledge Fluent}

\begin{itemize}
\item Define how $K$ should behave, in terms of observation histories
\item Show S.S.A. for $K$, prove that it behaves as required
\item Show various axiomatizations for $Obs()$, prove that they capture
existing accounts of knowledge
\end{itemize}

\section{Regressing Knowledge Queries}

\begin{itemize}
\item Expand on proof present in conference paper
\item Discuss intuitive appeal of the formulation
\end{itemize}

\section{Common Knowledge}

\begin{itemize}
\item Common Knowledge as a fixed-point
\item Direct encoding in a similar vein to $K$, using an explicit $C$ fluent
\end{itemize}
