Questions for Adrian:
=====================

full axiomatisation of cooking agents domain?
  - only in appendix, maybe not at al

reference to published version of each chapter?
  - no, get rid of these


Things to do
============

check Poss -> Legal in  proofs

clean up PKnows implementation, upload code to website, reference it etc

clean up MIndiGolog2 implementation, upload to website, reference it etc

ADP lambda abstraction

async domains => no common knowledge

cknowledge examples using x <= t notation

reconcile History definition from Obs and JE chapters

joint exec: enablers must be maximal

cknows => "proof" that expressivity is not enough
