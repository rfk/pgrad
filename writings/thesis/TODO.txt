check preface wording

intro:
   cooking agents - explicitly say domain is asyncrchonous
   property persitence - "the second order aspects" => specifically which ones?
   epxlicitly say "property persistence" early on
   scope/async - no "briefly discssus", show it's a natural extension!
   "potentially quite confusing" => less personal
      also too many question marks
      get less rhetorical, actually answer questions if you ask then
   scope/ck: "co-presense at commonly-observed event"
   scope/cs: bring forward unifying calculus citations

MG:
    stop saying "first incarnation so much!"
    move HTN-stuff out of discussion

JE:
    more use of "feasible" early on in intro
    generic picture of a P.E.S., with some short discussion
