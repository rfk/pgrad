(this will be an expansion of my conference paper on the topic \cite{kelly06hlp_dps}, which we're working on turning into a journal paper)

\section{Multi-Agent IndiGolog}
\begin{itemize}
\item Why is IndiGolog unsuited to specifying team behavior?
\item The three things we add - True Concurrency, Continuous Time, Natural Actions
\item Why are these things necessary?
\item Example programs from the cooking domain
\item Motivate the use of Oz throughout this chapter
\end{itemize}

\section{Continuous Time}
\begin{itemize}
\item Highlight changes to the semantics
\end{itemize}

\section{True Concurrency}
\begin{itemize}
\item Discuss various safety restrictions: actions must be possible, no skipping of actions
\item Show changes to concurrency operator
\item Discuss why other operators (esp prioritized concurrency) remain unchanged
\item Ways to maximize concurrency
\end{itemize}

\section{Natural Actions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Show changes to atomic action operator
\item Show changes to test operator
\item Contrast with handling of exogenous actions in ConGolog
\item Discuss ways to ensure that online execution consumes natural actions
in a greedy manner
\end{itemize}

\section{Executing the Program}
\begin{itemize}
\item Show an execution from the example program
\item Discuss coordination-without-communication in the style of Readylog
\item Shortcoming: lots of duplication of effort
\end{itemize}

\section{Distributed Execution Planning}
\begin{itemize}
\item Planning == logic program, so we can use existing techniques
\item Overview of Oz's ParallelSearch functionality
\item Details of implementation in Oz
\item Example execution from the example program show earlier
\item How to coordinate the search operator with multiple agents
  \begin{itemize}
  \item startplan() and endplan() actions
  \item signpost further discussion in later chapters
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item Many due to assumption of determinstic domain - we wont deal with these in this thesis
\item All actions available to all agents. 
\item Not applicable to sensing actions (e.g. is cake cooked?)
\item Basically signpost the rest of the thesis
\end{itemize}
