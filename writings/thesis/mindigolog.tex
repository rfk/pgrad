\section{Multi-Agent IndiGolog}
\begin{itemize}
\item IndiGolog is unsuited to specifying team behavior
\item We add: True Concurrency, Continuous Time, Natural Actions
\item Explanation of why each is desirable
\item Example programs from the cooking domain
\end{itemize}

\section{Continuous Time}
\begin{itemize}
\item Highlight changes to the semantics
\item Explain use of rational constraint solver
\end{itemize}

\section{True Concurrency}
\begin{itemize}
\item Safety restrictions: actions must be possible, no skipping of actions
\item Show changes to concurrency operator
\item Discuss why other operators (e.g. prioritized concurrency) remain unchanged
\item Ways to maximize concurrency
\end{itemize}

\section{Natural Actions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Show changes to atomic action operator
\item Show changes to test operator
\item Contrast with handling of exogenous actions in ConGolog
\item Discuss ways to ensure that online execution consumes natural actions
in a greedy manner
\end{itemize}

\section{Implementation in Oz}
\begin{itemize}
\item discuss basics of the software architecture, refer to appendix for details
\item clauses encoding Trans, Final, TransStar
\end{itemize}

\section{Executing the Program}
\begin{itemize}
\item Show an execution from the example program
\item Discuss coordination-without-communication in the style of Readylog
\item Shortcoming: lots of duplication of effort
\end{itemize}

\section{Distributed Execution Planning}
\begin{itemize}
\item Planning is a logic program, so we can use existing techniques
\item Details of implementation in Oz
\item How to coordinate the search operator with multiple agents: appoint a controller for the search
\end{itemize}

\section{Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
\item All actions known to all agents. 
\item No support for sensing actions (e.g. is cake cooked?)
\item Basically signpost the rest of the thesis
\end{itemize}
