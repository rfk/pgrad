This thesis develops three powerful extensions to the situation calculus that
facilitate reasoning about and planning for teams of agents in rich multi-agent
domains: a formalism for knowledge in asynchronous domains where some actions
may be hidden from some agents; support for reasoning about common knowledge
and other group-level epistemic modalities; and a technique for planning the
joint execution of a shared task with a partial ordering of the actions to
be performed.  Each new feature is firmly grounded in the standard effective
reasoning techniques of the situation calculus and demonstrated by a sample
implementation.
