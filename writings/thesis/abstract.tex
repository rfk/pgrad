This thesis develops several powerful extensions to the situation calculus,
enabling it to reasoning about and planning for teams of agents in rich 
multi-agent domains.  Driven by the desire to cooperative plan and perform
the execution of shared program, we add support for: hidden actions, common knowledge, joint executions.
