\label{ch:planning} %\minitoc



\section{What is Planning?}

\begin{itemize}
\item In this setting, it is the process of \emph{resolving nondeterminism} 
\item Planning should produce a program for the agent to follow, that does
not itself require deliberation to perform. \cite{levesque96what_is_planning,giacomo04sem_delib_indigolog} 
\item Must account for outcomes of sensing actions - some sort of branch/case
statement 
\item Must be epistemically feasible (show formalisation from \cite{giacomo04sem_delib_indigolog}) 
\end{itemize}

\section{What is Team Planning?}

\begin{itemize}
\item Produce a program for each agent 
\item Programs must include the necessary coordination actions/conditions 
\item We will need explicit syntax for synchronisation - \char`\"{}waiting
for an observation\char`\"{} 
\item Any interleaving of the programs must be a valid legal execution 
\item similar idea in strips: \cite{boutilier01partialorder_conc} 
\end{itemize}

\section{Resolving Non-Determinism}

\begin{itemize}
\item Hard Problem: removing only as much non-determinism as necessary 
\item Easier Problem: re-inserting non-determinism where possible 
\item Idea: plan by first \emph{completely} resolving nondeterminism, but
maintain auxiliary information that allows actions to be nondeterministically
interleaved where a legal execution is maintained. 
\end{itemize}

\section{Joint Executions}

\begin{itemize}
\item Based on \emph{prime event structures}, a formalism for partially-ordered
events
\item Ensure that actions are ordered where necesary, but unordered where
possible
\item Contain branching based on action outcomes
\item Can be built up an action at a time, much like standard situation
terms
\item Import definitions, theories etc from conference paper
\end{itemize}

\section{Distributed Planning}

\begin{itemize}
\item To obtain coordination without communication, must use common knowledge. 
\item Each agent can reason about CKnows(IsJointExec($\delta$,$\delta_{N}$))
to come up with a common plan, which they can then execute 
\item Or, they can communicate to share the planning workload by using distributed
knowledge DKnows(IsJointExec($\delta$,$\delta_{N}$)) 
\end{itemize}

\section{Coordination using Social Laws}

\begin{itemize}
\item Use an ordering to specify which actions are prefered 
\item Define the notion of a \char`\"{}safe\char`\"{} action 
\item Perform a joint action when its safety is common knowledge among actors 
\item Communicating to determine safety of actions 
\item ?? Ways to increase efficiency of this approach ?? 
\end{itemize}

\section{Managing the Search Operator}

\begin{itemize}
\item beginplan() and endplan() actions observable by all 
\item planning in the face of change - \char`\"{}restart\char`\"{} actions
incorporated into planning procedure 
\end{itemize}
