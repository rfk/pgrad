(the nature of this chapter will change depending on how complete my implementation is, but will definitely consider at least the following points)

\section{The Naive Approach}

\begin{itemize}
\item Just representing formulae as terms quickly leads to problems:
\item Exponential Growth of Formulae, compounded by regression
\item One-shot nature of theorem provers
\end{itemize}

\section{First-Order Shannon Graphs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Structure Sharing
\item Regression of a Shannon Graph
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Experimental data showing memory savings over naive approach
  \end{itemize}
\item Simplification, Theorem Proving
\item Re-using results from previous proofs
\end{itemize}
