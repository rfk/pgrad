\section{Problems with Naive Implementation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Just representing formulae as terms quickly leads to problems: 
\item Exponential Growth of Formulae, compounded by regression 
\end{itemize}

\section{First-Order Shannon Graphs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Structure Sharing 
\item Regression of a Shannon Graph 
\item Experimental data showing memory savings over naive approach 
\item Simplification, Theorem Proving 
\item Re-using results from previous proofs 
\end{itemize}

\section{TODO}

\begin{itemize}
\item Using constraint solvers to reason about time (\char`\"{}Theory Reasoning\char`\"{}) 
\end{itemize}
