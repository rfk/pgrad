\section{The Naive Approach}

\begin{itemize}
\item Just representing formulae as terms quickly leads to problems:
\item Exponential Growth of Formulae, compounded by regression
\end{itemize}

\section{First-Order Shannon Graphs}

\begin{itemize}
\item Structure Sharing
\item Regression of a Shannon Graph
\item Experimental data showing memory savings over naive approach
\item Simplification, Theorem Proving
\item Re-using results from previous proofs
\end{itemize}
