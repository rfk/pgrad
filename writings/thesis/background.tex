This is currently taken from my 2006 progress report, needs lots
of cleaning up.

\section{Distributed Problem Solving}

Multi-agent systems research is a large and diverse field, with a
correspondingly vast literature base. While an overview of the entire
field is beyond the scope of this report (such an overview may be
found in \cite{nwana95software_agents,mataric95issues_designing_agents}),
it is necessary to situate this work within the broader field by describing
the types of multi-agent applications that it targets.

Although often implicit in the literature, there is a clear distinction
between two types of systems involving multiple agents: \emph{Multi-Agent
Systems} (MAS) and \emph{Distributed Problem Solving} (DPS) \cite{nwana95software_agents,mataric95issues_designing_agents}.
MAS applications involve autonomous agents that act independently,
and may cooperate or compete depending on their individual goals and
desires. By contrast, DPS applications involve a team of agents cooperating
to solve a joint problem or perform a joint task. A detailed discussion
of the DPS field can be found in \cite{Durfee91dps}.

\begin{itemize}
\item Quickly highlight difference between open multi-agent systems and
distributed problem solving - explain what we're \emph{not} interested in.
\item Overview of DPS formalisms, task representation (HTN, TAEMS, etc...)
\item Briefly introduce HLP approach, discuss advantages.
\item Highlight success of Readylog team, but discuss limitations.
\item Overview of coordination techniques, esp. social laws for coordination without communication
\item Overview of distributed planning techniques \cite{desjardins99survey_dist_planning}
\end{itemize}

\section{The Situation Calculus}

The situation calculus is a formalism for reasoning about action and change 
based on first-order logic. A solid understanding of formal logic 
is assumed throughout this thesis;  see \cite{fitting96fol_book} for a 
comprehensive treatment.  It was first introduced by McCarthy and Hayes 
\cite{McCHay69sitcalc} and has since been significantly expanded and formalized 
\cite{reiter91frameprob,pirri99contributions_sitcalc,levesque98sc_foundations}.
The notation and conventions used in this thesis are derived from 
\cite{levesque98sc_foundations}.

The situation calculus is built on three fundamental notions:
\begin{itemize}
 \item An \noun{action} is an instantaneous event that causes the state of
       the world to change
 \item A \noun{situation} is a history of all the actions that have occurred
       in the world, thus determining the state of the world
 \item A \noun{fluent} is a particular aspect of the state of the world
\end{itemize}

Actions and situations are represented by function terms in the logic,
while fluents are predicates or functions that are restricted to taking
a situation term as their final argument.  These notions will be formally
defined in subsequent paragraphs.

As originally conceived, the situation calculus describes domains in which 
there is a single agent who has complete control over the world and can
perform only a single action at a time.  To provide a formalism expressive
enough for the righ multi-agent domains targetted in this thesis, several 
important extensions to the situation calculus must be incorporated:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Multiple agents acting in the world, by having the first argument of each       action term identify the agent performing the action as in \cite{shapiro98specifying_ma_systems,shapiro01casl_feat_inter}.
 \item Multiple actions occurring at the same instant, by using sets of individual actions to build up situation terms as in \cite{lin92sc_conc,pinto94temporal,reiter96sc_nat_conc}
 \item Actions with  a finite duration, by breaking them into explicit start and end actions as in \cite{pinto94temporal}
 \item An explicit notion of time, as in \cite{pinto94temporal,reiter96sc_nat_conc}
\end{itemize}

The language of the situation calculus, $\mathcal{L}_{sitcalc}$, is a language
of multi-sorted second-order logic with equality.

\begin{itemize}
\item Basic Sitcalc: origins with McCarthy \cite{McCHay69sitcalc}, formalizations by Reiter et al \cite{reiter01kia,pirri99contributions_sitcalc,levesque98sc_foundations}
\item incorporate \cite{pinto99ramification,pinto98interacting_effects} and the unfortunately unpublished \cite{pinto00action_interaction}
\item Our own customizations, e.g. "Action Description Predicates" \cite{kelly07sc_persistence}
\item Concurrent Actions, Continuous Time, Natural Actions \cite{pinto94temporal,reiter96sc_nat_conc}
\item Reasoning (Regression, Decidable Fragments)
\item Related approaches (Fluent Calculus, Event Calculus)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item justify focusing on sitcalc by highlighting deep links between the formalisms
  \end{itemize}
\item Briefly highlight things we \emph{don't} consider - nondeterministic/probabilistic actions, decision theoretic aspects, etc - and explain why.
\item maybe also "stratified definitions" from \cite{pinto94temporal}
\end{itemize}

\section{High-Level Program Execution}

\begin{itemize}
\item Basic Golog, operators, semantics \cite{levesque97golog}
\item Highlight the vast body of similar approaches, e.g. Dynamic Logic
\item So why golog? - full power of sitcalc, answer extraction for planning.
\item Discuss idea of 'Legal Execution' in depth
\item ConGolog \cite{giacomo00congolog}.  Also some discussion of related
semantics, such as CCS 
\item IndiGolog - highlight online/offline distinction and connections to coordination and planning \cite{giacomo99indigolog}
\item TConGolog - highlight deficiencies \cite{pinto99tcongolog}
\item Other Gologs (DTGolog, HTNGolog, GTGolog)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item for completeness only, we have already established that we aren't operating in domains appropriate for them
  \item But, take time to highlight rich cross-pollination between works, and that our results similarly have potential for integration with these approaches
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Epistemic Reasoning}

\begin{itemize}
\item Knowledge, Distributed Knowledge, Common Knowledge \cite{halpern90knowledge_distrib,fagin95}
\item Importance of Common Knowledge for Coordination
\item Knowledge in the Situation Calculus
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Reasoning about Knowledge \cite{moore80know_act,scherl03sc_knowledge}
  \item Use in a multi-agent setting (??what's the best reference)
  \item Concurrency and time \cite{scherl03conc_knowledge}
  \item Shortcomings of multi-agent extensions
  \item Decidable fragments, weakening for computational efficiency
  \end{itemize}
\item Epistemic feasibility of plans: \cite{giacomo04sem_delib_indigolog,Lesperance01epi_feas_casl}
