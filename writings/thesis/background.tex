\section{Distributed Problem Solving}

\begin{itemize}
\item Quickly highlight difference between open multi-agent systems and
distributed problem solving - explain what we're \emph{not} interested in.
\item Overview of DPS formalisms, task representation (HTN, TAEMS, etc...)
\item Focus on Readylog, but discuss weaknesses
\item Coordinarion, esp. social laws for coordination without communication
\item Distributed Planning
\end{itemize}

\section{First-Order Logic}

\begin{itemize}
\item The Basics
\item Theorem Proving
\item Shannon Graphs
\end{itemize}

\section{The Situation Calculus}

\begin{itemize}
\item Basic Sitcalc
\item Action Description Predicates
\item Concurrent Actions, Continuous Time, Natural Actions
\item Reasoning (Regression, Decidable Fragments)
\item Related approaches (Fluent Calculus, Event Calculus)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item justify focussing on sitcalc by highlighting deep links between the formalisms
  \end{itemize}
\item Things we \emph{dont} consider - nondetermisistic/probabilistic actions, decision theoretic aspects, belief.
\end{itemize}

\section{Golog}

\begin{itemize}
\item Basic Golog, operators, semanitcs
\item ConGolog
\item IndiGolog - highlight online/offline distinction and connections to coordination and planning
\item TConGolog - highlight deficiencies
\item Other Gologs (DTGolog, HTNGolog, GTGolog)
  \begin{itemize}
  \item for completeness only, we have already establisheid that we arent operating in domains appropriate for them
  \item But, take time to highlight rich cross-polination between works, and how our results have potential for integration with these approaches
  \begin{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Epistemic Reasoning}

\begin{itemize}
\item Knowledge, Distributed Knowledge, Common Knowledge
\item Important of Common Knowledge for Communication
\item Knowledge in the Situation Calculus
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Reasoning about Knowledge
  \item Shortcomings of mulit-agent extensions
  \item Deciable fragments, weakenings for computational efficiency
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
