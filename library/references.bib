	environment for multiagent research. We introduce an approach using
	Hierarchical Task Network planning in each of the agents for high-level
	coordination and description of team strategies. Our approach facilitates
	the maintenance of expert knowledge specified as team strategies
	separated from the agent implementation. By combining high level
	plans with reactive basic operators, agents can pursue a grand strategy
	while staying reactive to changes in the environment. Our results
	show that the use of a planner in a multiagent system is both possible
	and useful despite the constraints in dynamic environments. },

	can be speeded up by exploring subtrees of a search tree in parallel.
	This paper presents distributed search engines that achieve parallelism
	by distribution across networked computers. The main point of the
	paper is a simple design of the parallel search engine. Simplicity
	comes as an immediate consequence of clearly separating search, concurrency,
	and distribution. The obtained distributed search engines are simple
	yet offer substantial speedup on standard network computers.},
