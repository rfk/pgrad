	Hierarchical Task Network planning in each of the agents for high-level
	coordination and description of team strategies. Our approach facilitates
	the maintenance of expert knowledge specified as team strategies
	separated from the agent implementation. By combining high level
	plans with reactive basic operators, agents can pursue a grand strategy
	while staying reactive to changes in the environment. Our results
	show that the use of a planner in a multiagent system is both possible
	and useful despite the constraints in dynamic environments. }

  abstract = {<p> This short tutorial explains how to do Prolog-style logic programming
	in Oz. We give programming examples that can be run interactively
	on the Mozart system, which implements Oz. The Oz language is the
	result of a decade of research into programming based on logic. The
	Oz computation model subsumes both search-based logic programming
	and committed-choice (concurrent) logic programming with deep guards.
	Furthermore, Oz provides new abilities, such as first-class top levels
	and constant-time merge, that exist in neither of its ancestors.
	We show two of the Oz interactive graphic tools, namely the Browser
	and the Explorer, which are useful for developing and running logic
	programs. We conclude by explaining why logic programming is just
	a prelude to the real strengths of Oz, namely constraint programming
	and distributed programming. In these two areas, Oz is equal to or
	better than any other system existing in the world today. For example,
	for compute-intensive constraint problems Oz provides parallel search
	engines that can be used transparently, i.e., without changing the
	problem specification. </p>},

  abstract = {Search in constraint programming is a time consuming task. Search
	can be speeded up by exploring subtrees of a search tree in parallel.
	This paper presents distributed search engines that achieve parallelism
	by distribution across networked computers. The main point of the
	paper is a simple design of the parallel search engine. Simplicity
	comes as an immediate consequence of clearly separating search, concurrency,
	and distribution. The obtained distributed search engines are simple
	yet offer substantial speedup on standard network computers.},
