Asynchronous Multi-Agent Domains in the Situation Calculus
----------------------------------------------------------

Presenter:   Ryan Kelly
Supervisor:  Adrian Pearce

= Please note this is a PhD Completion Seminar and will run for approx 90 min =

The situation calculus is a popular formalism for reasoning and planning
in dynamic environments.  In this PhD completion seminar, I will discuss
three powerful extensions to the situation calculus that facilitate its use
in rich, asynchronous multi-agent domains:

  * A formalism for reasoning about knowledge that accounts for potentially
    arbitrarily-long sequences of hidden actions.
  * A formalism for group-level knowledge modalities, such as common knowledge,
    that is amenable to effective reasoning techniques based on regression.
  * Data structures and techniques for planning the cooperative execution of
    a shared task, allowing for hidden actions and run-time sensing.

As both a motivation for and a demonstration of these techniques, I will
discuss the implementation of MIndiGolog.  This is a multi-agent programming
language built on the situation calculus, in which a team of agents can
cooperatively plan and perform the execution of a shared task.


Bio:  Ryan has been PhD candidate at the University of Melbourne since 2005,
after completing a B.E./B.C.S  double degree here in 2004.  His work has
focused on logical approaches to planning in multi-agent systems.  He is
supervised by Dr. Adrian Pearce and is terribly excited to be using the words
"PhD" and "completion" in the same sentence.
